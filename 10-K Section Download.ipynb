The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company&#x2019;s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#x2019;s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody&#x2019;s Investors Service. In March 2016, Moody&#x2019;s downgraded 3M&#x2019;s rating from Aa3 to A1, revised 3M&#x2019;s outlook from negative to stable, and affirmed the Company&#x2019;s short-term rating of P-1. This ratings action followed 3M&#x2019;s announcement of its new five-year plan for the period 2016 through 2020 in which the Company communicated its intent to further increase financial leverage. The Company&#x2019;s credit ratings have served to lower 3M&#x2019;s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The Company&#x2019;s ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could impact 3M&#x2019;s credit rating in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company&#x2019;s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.</font>\r\n",

Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in&#160;response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company&#8217;s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">In the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial&#160;markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be tightening in the credit&#160;markets, low liquidity and&#160;extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This&#160;could have a number of effects on&#160;the Company&#8217;s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in&#160;product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance&#160;purchases of the Company&#8217;s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt. Other income and&#160;expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses&#160;realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity&#160;securities and other investments; changes in interest rates;&#160;increases or decreases in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.&#160;Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic&#160;uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the&#160;future on the Company&#8217;s financial instruments differing significantly&#160;from the fair values currently assigned to them. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">Global markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company&#8217;s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&amp;D. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating&#160;the Company's&#160;products and infringing on&#160;its&#160;intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | </font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">8</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related services, including third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company&#8217;s existing products. The Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone subsidize users&#8217; purchases of the device.

These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | </font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">9</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">Future operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on&#160;the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220;</font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company&#8221;</font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;above, also could affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components</font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">. </font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.  </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | </font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">10</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company&#8217;s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects.

This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company&#8217;s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac&#8217;s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">With respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company&#8217;s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers&#8217; perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the Company&#8217;s iOS devices rather than its competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android.

In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. The intellectual property rights claims against the Company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company's cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the Company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it.

The Company&#8217;s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company&#8217;s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply chain. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company's business and harm to the Company's reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company&#8217;s R&amp;D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company&#8217;s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company&#8217;s other products. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company&#8217;s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company&#8217;s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company&#8217;s stock price is subject to volatility.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company&#8217;s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | </font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">15</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. Margins on sales of the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar&#8217;s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Credit ratings and pricing of the Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of </font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">September&#160;24, 2016</font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">, a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:24px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;\">The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\">The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") and other tax authorities and governmental bodies.

There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | </font><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:8pt;\">16</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><a name=\"s8D73094E7B93567FA56C7CB51321C1F8\"></a></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;\"><tr><td style=\"width:60px;\"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:top\"></td></tr></table>"

Risk Factors</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:20px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our Commercial Airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the continued operations of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:20px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;\">6</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s2B5F9D44903056089BB7DE833623028A\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed, if other production rate changes result in significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. Further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into early build 787 aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:20px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">U.S. DoD</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">.

Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company&#8217;s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:20px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;\">U.S. DoD</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes.

While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2016, we recorded a reach-forward loss of </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">$1,128 million</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;on the </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">USAF KC-46A Tanker</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;contract, primarily driven by additional costs attributable to design changes, testing and manufacturing complexity. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:20px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">USAF KC-46A Tanker</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">, and commercial and military satellites.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:20px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Our BDS business generated approximately </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;\">29%</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;of its </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;\">2016</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements.

The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees&#160;we ultimately expect to realize&#160;is recognized as revenue in the construction period.

If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier&#8217;s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. For example, we continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers&#8217; assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a)&#160;the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b)&#160;the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c)&#160;the units&#8217; expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:20px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance.

Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers.

Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.&#160; We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues.&#160; Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars.&#160; There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Risk Factors</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses. Many of these risks are not within the company's control and could materially impact the company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company&#8217;s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company&#8217;s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company&#8217;s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to debt markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company&#8217;s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company&#8217;s own results of operations and financial condition depends.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">The scope of Chevron&#8217;s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the company&#8217;s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">The company&#8217;s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company&#8217;s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Cyberattacks targeting Chevron&#8217;s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company&#8217;s business and results of operations </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business.&#160;Cyber threat actors could compromise the company&#8217;s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or assets, access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, including intellectual property, business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company&#8217;s business and results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">The company&#8217;s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;Chevron&#8217;s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas </font></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;\">20</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Chevron&#8217;s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the company&#8217;s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company&#8217;s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to Ecuador matters, see </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;\">Note 1</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">8</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">FS-45</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company&#8217;s results of operations or financial condition. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevron&#8217;s business</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;The company&#8217;s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company&#8217;s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company&#8217;s operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company&#8217;s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company&#8217;s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company&#8217;s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company&#8217;s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. In addition, changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase Chevron&#8217;s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron&#8217;s hydrocarbon and other products</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In the years ahead, companies in the energy industry, like Chevron, may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to GHG emissions.&#160; Such regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company&#8217;s oil and gas resources economically infeasible.&#160; Although the IEA&#8217;s World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate global demand for oil to continue increasing until 2040, and even GHG-constrained scenarios (such as the IEA&#8217;s 450 case) anticipate significant demand for petroleum and natural gas given their respective advantages in transportation and power generation, if a new onset of regulation contributes to a decline in the demand for the company&#8217;s products, this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">International agreements (e.g., the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol) and national (e.g., carbon tax, cap-and-trade or efficiency standards), regional and state legislation (e.g., California AB32 and SB32; low carbon fuel standards) and regulatory measures (e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's methane performance standards) that aim to limit or reduce GHG </font></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;\">21</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are adopting policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In the United States, the company has been complying with currently implemented programs such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard program, and related volume standards, and state regulations such as California AB32, including the cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Follow-on legislation to California AB32, known as California SB32, was signed into law in 2016, with effect in 2020, and is currently in the scoping plan phase. Separately, other states and localities have also sought to directly regulate GHG emissions through mechanisms such as, for example, a carbon tax. Many of the foregoing are still in a proposal stage and others face legal challenge or legislative efforts to be repealed or significantly reformed. Thus, even with respect to existing regulatory compliance obligations, the landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact that such regulations will have on the company.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">GHG emissions-related laws and related regulations and the effects of operating in a potentially carbon-constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company&#8217;s hydrocarbon-based products, make the company&#8217;s products more expensive, adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company&#8217;s resources, and adversely affect the company&#8217;s sales volumes, revenues and margins. GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) that could be regulated include, among others, those associated with the company&#8217;s exploration and production of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers&#8217; or customers&#8217; use of the company&#8217;s hydrocarbon products. Many of these activities, such as consumers&#8217; and customers&#8217; use of the company&#8217;s products, as well as actions taken by the company&#8217;s competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the company&#8217;s control. In addition, increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company&#8217;s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company&#8217;s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. Additionally, the company assesses carbon pricing risks by considering carbon costs in these forecasts. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon dioxide injection, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction, the company&#8217;s activities in it and market conditions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The ultimate effect of international agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions on the company&#8217;s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company&#8217;s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions-related agreements, legislation and measures on the company&#8217;s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:125%;padding-bottom:6px;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#ff0000;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In preparing the company&#8217;s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron&#8217;s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company&#8217;s business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.</font></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;\">22</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><a name=\"sC86D008E5E23527992562203BD19296B\"></a></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:4px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div>"

Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the United States and in emerging countries. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Inventory management remains an area of focus. We have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. In addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments. Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Any of the above factors could have a material

provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as Data Center, Collaboration, and Service Provider Video, in addition to longer sales cycles. Sales to the service provider market decreased in 2016. At various times in the past, including in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, we experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers. Sales to the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such sales weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors&#8217; financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales.

These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key priority and growth areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as SDN products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as \"white box\" hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions.

Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">19</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s5EA6EDED8AE30E2F3ADDEE75B6362665\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">partners.

financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. We have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past. Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See the risk factor above entitled &#8220;Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.&#8221;  </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand in the industry for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales. </font></div><div

capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments. Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.

Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. Many of our strategic initiatives and investments we have made, and our architectural approach, are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering an ever-increasing array of IT-based products and services. For example, several years ago we launched our Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS), our next-generation enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing, network, storage access and virtualization resources in a single system, which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center. While our Cisco UCS offering remains a significant focus area for us, several market transitions are also shaping our strategies and investments.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">One such market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable, flexible and virtual networks. We believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine ASICs, hardware and software elements together. Other examples include our focus on security; the market transition related to digital transformation and IoT; and the transition in cloud.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The process of developing new technology, including technology related to more programmable, flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions&#8212; such as security, digital transformation and IoT, and cloud&#8212; is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers&#8217; changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on &#8220;white box&#8221; hardware, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive, industry-leading security that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected. Over the last few years, we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions. As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology.  If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The products and technologies in our other product categories and key growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO CHARGES RELATED TO DISCONTINUANCES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS OR RESTRUCTURINGS</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses.

We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect.

risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">From time to time, we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter. These charges may occur in any particular quarter, resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. See the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled &#8220;We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers&#8217; changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer&#8221; for additional information. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION AND WILL LIKELY INCREASE DEMANDS ON OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Further, provision of greater levels of services, support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">24</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s5EA6EDED8AE30E2F3ADDEE75B6362665\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPETITION AND MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND NET INCOME </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:4px;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CHANGES OR OTHER FACTORS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. Emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and also in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, including impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States; and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on

style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. We expect demand for customer financing to continue, and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects.

Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A portion of our sales is derived through our distributors. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. We maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. However, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers&#8217; ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR EARNINGS </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary. For information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.&#8221; Our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.

These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies. </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">26</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s5EA6EDED8AE30E2F3ADDEE75B6362665\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Currently, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 12(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">27</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s5EA6EDED8AE30E2F3ADDEE75B6362665\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION MAY OCCUR DUE TO PRODUCTION AND SALE OF COUNTERFEIT VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As is the case with leading products&#160;around&#160;the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce&#160;counterfeit&#160;versions of our products. While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting&#160;counterfeiters&#160;and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales,&#160;could adversely affect our operating results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on Internet product or service sales, and access charges for Internet service providers. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS COULD HARM OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SALES </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the United States or other countries could affect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe that there may be future changes in U.S. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers&#8217; network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including \"net neutrality\" rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the United States, our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory authorities. In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">FAILURE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. For example, Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">28</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s5EA6EDED8AE30E2F3ADDEE75B6362665\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">to an alleged underpayment of income taxes, social taxes, interest, and penalties by a Brazilian distributor. This claim was dismissed on its merits during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;\">$249 million</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;\">$1.3 billion</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;for interest, and  </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;\">$1.2 billion</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;\">July&#160;30, 2016</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">. We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.

Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 34 countries, including the United States, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity.

However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.

Increasing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; possible new or increased taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sugar-sweetened beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce demand for or increase the cost of our sugar-sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system's costs and capacity.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints that could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we do not address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Consumer preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, especially the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients and obesity concerns; shifting consumer demographics, including aging populations; changes in consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; location of origin or source of products and ingredients; and competitive product and pricing pressures. If we fail to address these changes, or do not successfully anticipate future changes in consumer preferences, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.  </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace could hurt our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive. We compete with major international beverage companies that, like our Company, operate in multiple geographic areas, as well as numerous companies that are primarily regional or local in operation. In many countries in which we do business, including the United States, PepsiCo is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl&#233;, DPSG, Groupe Danone, Mondel&#275;z, Kraft, Suntory and Unilever. In certain markets, our competition also includes major beer companies that also distribute nonalcoholic beverages. Our beverage products also compete against private label brands developed by retailers, some of which are Coca-Cola system customers. Our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the global market or in various local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. If we do not continue to strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable categories in the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">10</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, we cannot assure you that despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality we or all of our bottling partners will always meet these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions of products, such as value-added dairy products, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. If we or our bottling partners fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our beverage products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Public debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (\"4-MEI,\" a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-type beverages); or substances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (\"BPA,\" an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans), may affect consumers' preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern about actual or perceived health consequences of the presence of such ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging materials, whether or not justified, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling or sale of our beverages; possible new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may reduce demand for, our beverage products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Achieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our&#160;innovation&#160;activities in turn depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity may negatively affect our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are derived from agricultural commodities such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea in the manufacture and packaging of our beverage products. Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to implement programs focused on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food security through joint efforts with bottlers, farmers, communities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture, the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the retail channel, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system's profitability. In addition, in developed markets, discounters and value stores, as well as the volume of transactions through e-commerce, are growing at a rapid pace. The nonalcoholic beverage retail landscape is also very dynamic and constantly evolving in emerging and developing markets, where modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing environment and retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">11</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we are unable to expand our operations in emerging and developing markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match consumers&#8217; demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. In 2016, we used 72 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $22.0 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. For information regarding the estimated impact of currency fluctuations on our consolidated and operating segment net operating revenues for 2016 and 2015, refer to the heading \"Operations Review - Net Operating Revenues\" set forth in Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this report. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, would not materially affect our financial results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. We cannot assure you, however, that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some credit rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major bottlers. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottlers' financial performance; changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies' perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our or our major bottlers' current or future financial performance and financial condition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of certain bottlers in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottlers' interest expense could increase, which would reduce our equity income.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could suffer.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, many of our bottling partners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottling partners through a combination of pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts, they may take actions that, while maximizing their own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their energy and resources to business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long run, have an adverse effect on our profitability.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">12</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If our bottling partners' financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners and, therefore, the success of our business depends on our bottling partners' financial strength and profitability. While under our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners' financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners' income or loss. Our bottling partners' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions in the territories in which they operate; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; and, if applicable, could result in a decrease in our equity income and/or result in impairments of our equity method investments.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates and the geographic mix of our income before taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix, or foreign exchange rates could reduce our after-tax income. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our annual tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open. For instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for the period, plus interest. The IRS may add a claim for penalties at a later time. The disputed amounts largely relate to a transfer pricing matter involving the appropriate amount of taxable income the Company should report in the United States in connection with its licensing of intangible property to certain related foreign licensees regarding the manufacturing, distribution, sale, marketing and promotion of products in overseas markets. We are currently contesting the IRS' claims in the U.S. Tax Court. If the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, it would likely also seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent tax years.&#160;Consequently, if this dispute were to be ultimately determined adversely to us, the additional tax, interest and any potential penalties could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The current U.S. administration has listed tax reform among its top policy priorities, and the U.S. Congress is reviewing various legislative tax proposals. Until further details emerge, it is premature to predict how such proposals ultimately may impact our business. Potential legislation is likely to include provisions that impact our business both favorably and unfavorably as compared to current law. Pending further development of those provisions and potential legislative enactment, we are unable to determine whether the net impact would produce a positive or negative impact, and what actions we may take as a consequence.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Increased or new indirect taxes in the United States and throughout the world could negatively affect our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as \"indirect taxes,\" including import duties, excise taxes, sales or value-added taxes, taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including indirect taxes imposed by state and local governments. In addition, in the past, the U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a plethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar taxes on beverages, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues and profitability.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">13</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of energy or fuels could affect our profitability.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our Company-owned or -controlled bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to customers.

An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in countries in which we have concentrate plants, or in any of the major markets in which our Company-owned or         -controlled bottlers operate, that may be caused by increasing demand or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, or the like could increase our operating costs and negatively impact our profitability.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our independent bottling partners also operate large fleets of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to their own customers and use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate their own bottling plants and distribution facilities. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in any of the major markets in which our independent bottling partners operate could increase the affected independent bottling partners' operating costs and thus indirectly negatively impact our results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients, other raw materials or packaging materials could harm our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including HFCS, sucrose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw materials such as orange and other fruit juice and juice concentrates; and packaging materials such as PET for bottles and aluminum for cans. The prices for these ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Substantial increases in the prices of our or our bottling partners' ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would increase our and our bottling partners' operating costs and could reduce our profitability. Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from a higher cost of ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials could affect affordability in some markets and reduce Coca-Cola system sales. In addition, some of our ingredients, such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin and ascorbic acid, as well as some packaging containers, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers, and certain other ingredients are available from only one source each. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political or other risks. We cannot assure you that we and our bottling partners will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredient that is available from a limited number of suppliers or from only one source</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The citrus industry is impacted by the variability of weather conditions and by greening disease, which affect the supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate, which are important raw materials for our business. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices. Adverse weather conditions may affect the supply of other agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For example, drought conditions in certain parts of the United States may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">An increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, packaging materials or cans and other containers that may be caused by a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; by supplier quality and reliability issues; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like could negatively impact our net operating revenues and profits.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We and our bottlers currently offer nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotax and/or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers' increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale in any of the major markets in which we operate, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues and profitability.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">14</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is below a \"safe harbor\" threshold that may be established, is naturally occurring, is the result of necessary cooking or is subject to another applicable exception. One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added to the lists in the future, can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. With respect to substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65, the Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to substances that are already listed, the Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other parties, however, have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted and our reputation may be damaged.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We rely on networks and information systems and other technology (\"information systems\"), including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, mergers and acquisitions and research and development. We use information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. In addition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company personnel and our bottlers and other customers, suppliers and consumers. Because information systems are critical to many of the Company's operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social-activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. In addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrate or finished products. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to the reputation and credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating revenues. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">15</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Like most major corporations, the Company's information systems are a target of attacks.

In order to address risks to our information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of Company personnel. The Company maintains an information risk management program which is supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee. As part of this program, reports that include analysis of emerging risks as well as the Company's plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could negatively impact our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In 2016, our net operating revenues in the United States were $19.9 billion, or 48 percent, of our total net operating revenues. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, in the United States could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages in our flagship market. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private label brands. Softer consumer demand for our beverages in the United States could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Unfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets could hurt our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of our products in international markets. In 2016, our operations outside the United States accounted for $22.0&#160;billion, or 52 percent, of our total net operating revenues. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets, including uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom's impending withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers' purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Product boycotts resulting from political activism could reduce demand for our products, while restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders, price controls, limitation on profits, import authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities which have been or may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it impossible for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. The imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental action or policy, could also negatively affect our business. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of our advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters.

Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola system's bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to product safety or quality, human and workplace rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image and corporate reputation, our business may suffer.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. We cannot assure you, however, that our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights will have the desired impact on our products' brand image and on consumer preferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or \"spurious\" products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives engage in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These engagements in public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with human and workplace rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Furthermore, in June 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which outlines how businesses should implement the corporate responsibility to respect human rights principles included in the United Nations \"Protect, Respect and Remedy\" framework on human rights. Through our Human Rights Policy, Code of Business Conduct and Supplier Guiding Principles, and our participation in the United Nations Global Compact, as well as our active participation in the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights, we made a number of commitments to respect all human rights. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting one or more of the 30 human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our Company's overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products&#8217; acceptance by consumers. In addition, if we fail to protect our associates&#8217; and our supply chain employees&#8217; human rights, or inadvertently discriminate against any group of associates or hiring prospects, our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, which could have an adverse impact on our overall business.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">17</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our Company's business is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling and product stewardship, the protection of the environment, and employment and labor practices.

Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, or regulations to limit or eliminate the use of BPA, or regulations to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. In addition, failure to comply with environmental, health or safety requirements, U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or a cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to our Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for the affected periods.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we are not able to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives.

A decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from unfavorable credit market conditions, as well as general unfavorable economic conditions, may also cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which could reduce the demand for our beverages and negatively affect our and our bottling partners' financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Default by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with associates and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our associates. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations' or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity. Restructuring activities and the announcement of plans for future restructuring activities may result in a general increase in insecurity among some Company associates and some employees in other parts of the Coca-Cola system, which may have negative implications on employee morale, work performance, escalation of grievances and successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.

In addition, we routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring, taking control of or managing acquired bottling operations, other businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in restructuring and integrating them into our Company's operating and internal control structures. We may also experience delays in extending our Company's internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired or controlled bottling operations or other businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. Our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations and other acquired businesses or brands. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such bottling operations or other acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">19</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we do not successfully manage our refranchising activities, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As part of our strategic initiative to refocus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we are refranchising Company-owned or -controlled bottling operations in North America and China. In addition, in December 2016, we announced that we reached an agreement regarding the transition of Anheuser-Busch InBev&#8217;s (\"ABI\") controlling interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited (\"CCBA\") and our intention to hold CCBA&#8217;s territories temporarily until they can be refranchised to other partners. For more information regarding this transaction, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may become a distraction for, senior management. In addition, in connection with refranchising transactions in North America, we recorded, and we expect will continue to record, losses primarily related to the derecognition of intangible assets transferred or that will be transferred to bottling partners. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete refranchising transactions on our expected timetable and on terms and conditions favorable to us; that our refranchising bottling or joint venture partners will be efficient and aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system; or that we will be able to maintain good relationships with the refranchised bottling operations. If we are unable to complete contemplated refranchising transactions timely, on favorable terms and with partners who share our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we do not realize the economic benefits we anticipate from our productivity initiatives or are unable to successfully manage their possible negative consequences, our business operations could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this report. We have incurred, and we expect will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses with the programs and activities associated with our productivity initiatives. If we are unable to implement some or all of these actions fully or in the envisioned timeframe, or we otherwise do not timely capture the efficiencies, cost savings and revenue growth opportunities we anticipate from these actions, our results of operations for future periods could be negatively affected. In addition, some of the actions we are taking in furtherance of our productivity initiatives may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation.

We may not be able to successfully compete for and attract the high-quality and diverse employee talent we want and our future business needs may require. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled associates due to insecurity resulting from our ongoing productivity initiatives, refranchising transactions and organizational changes could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness.

You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \"Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item&#160;7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item&#160;8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We operate in markets that are highly competitive. We compete principally based on customer experience, price, store location and appearance, and quality, availability, assortment and presentation of merchandise. In each market we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, MRO companies and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers, some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours, as our customers now routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. We use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;7</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\" href=\"#s3E2C644F969656F2B8128F26C7B2DCEA\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">margins or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. As we continue to see increasing strength in the housing and home improvement market, resulting changes in demand will put further pressure on our ability to meet customer needs and expectations and maintain high service levels. In addition, each of our primary customer groups &#8211; DIY, DIFM and Pro &#8211; have different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. We also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of &#8211; or within &#8211; a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. We have implemented programs like BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS and direct fulfillment, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers&#8217; needs and expectations. Customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates. Failure to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to provide quick and low-cost delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly as the economy continues to improve and the labor market tightens. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. In managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. For these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. Our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of ransomware; </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;8</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\" href=\"#s3E2C644F969656F2B8128F26C7B2DCEA\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices.&#160;We use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. Multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments. We also continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive user-friendly interface for our customers, as evidenced by our recent redesign of our homedepot.com website. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage, and could become subject to further litigation and enforcement actions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers&#8217; personal information, preferences and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential Company information. We also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, our private label credit cards, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems.

In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product.

Other factors beyond our control &#8211; including unemployment and foreclosure rates; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism and other conditions beyond our control &#8211; could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business and our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers&#8217; noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers&#8217; logistics or supply chain networks, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers&#8217; control.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and information technology systems. These initiatives, such as Project Sync and COM, our new Customer Order Management system, are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term and lead to product availability issues. Failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. In addition, our improved supply chain and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation.

To effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors&#8217; products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors.

However, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. In addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition of Interline, which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our professional customers and increased our share of the MRO market. During fiscal 2016, we continued to develop and implement our strategy with Interline. Our goal is to serve all of our different Pro customer groups through one integrated approach to drive growth and capture market share in the retail, services and MRO markets, and this strategy depends, in part, on our continuing integration of Interline. As with any acquisition, we need to successfully integrate Interline&#8217;s products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. Furthermore, even if Interline is successfully integrated, the acquisition may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with the Interline business and the wholesale market.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business.

As a result, we face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments.

If demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platforms in any of our market segments, our gross margin and revenue would decrease. In addition, when products are introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-weight:bold;\">We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-style:italic;\">Global or regional conditions may harm our financial results. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&amp;D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas.

If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. Our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. Factory-planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Conversely, if product demand increases, we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand.

Production of integrated circuits is a complex process. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errata.&#160;Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruption in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions&#8212;all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields.

Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials. However, for certain materials, we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. In addition, consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. The inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. Production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production, such as water, silicon, electricity, gases, and other materials. The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products, particularly those related to networking, mobile and communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and NAND flash memory. If any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, there are regulatory and other requirements, restrictions, and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct, with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate, regulating supplier behaviors, and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies. Increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-style:italic;\">We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata or other product issues. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications) may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, may also contain defects. We could face risks if products that we design, manufacture or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies, or applications through the Internet of Things, including wearables, drones and transportation, and industrial and consumer uses.

Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-weight:bold;\">We must attract, retain, and motivate key employees. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">To be competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees.

To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based and other performance-based incentive awards such as restricted stock units (RSUs) and cash bonuses. Also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain an inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. If our share-based or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">20</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:right;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"#s772CB2E4B4965FFF8DB0AD0523066449\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:right;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-weight:bold;\">We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-style:italic;\">Third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network, products, services, and infrastructure. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology (IT) systems. Additionally, malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide. Due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products, we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. We are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, employees, and customers; or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others. We believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication. From time to time, we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network, products, services, or infrastructure. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. In some instances, we, our customers, and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools and/or changes or patches to our products and services, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to,&#160;for example, rebuilding internal systems, reduced inventory value, providing modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties.&#160;In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users, and reduce demand for our products and services.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-style:italic;\">We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.

Distributors and other third parties may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. They may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">22</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:right;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"#s772CB2E4B4965FFF8DB0AD0523066449\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:right;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#0860a8;font-style:italic;\">We face risks related to business transactions with U.S. government entities. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the U.S. government.

A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system&#8217;s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline.</font></div><div><a name=\"sEE9BDDFADD3257CC82013E61DCF407CC\"></a></div><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"padding-top:18px;padding-bottom:18px;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;\"><tr><td style=\"width:96px;\"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:top\"></td></tr></table>"

As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the United States, increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. Outside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company&#8217;s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In the ordinary course of business, Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November&#160;1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company&#8217;s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s operating results.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Changes in tax laws or regulations, including tax reform proposals in the U.S., Belgium and Switzerland, could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate and results of operations.

These rights are essential to the Company&#8217;s businesses and materially important to the Company&#8217;s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company&#8217;s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company&#8217;s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the United States, manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The BPCIA, enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries. For example, a key patent for ZYTIGA</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><sup style=\"vertical-align:top;line-height:120%;font-size:7pt\">&#174;</sup></font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;is currently subject to patent litigation and several IPR proceedings brought by generic companies seeking to invalidate the patent. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the &#8220;at-risk&#8221; launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company&#8217;s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8212;Intellectual Property&#8221; of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company&#8217;s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company&#8217;s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors&#8217; development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of us, could negatively impact sales of the Company&#8217;s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">For the Company&#8217;s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company&#8217;s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company&#8217;s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company&#8217;s consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers&#8217; private-label brands.  If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:right;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><div style=\"padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;text-align:-moz-right;\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;width:99.0234375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;margin-left:auto;margin-right:0;\"><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td><td style=\"width:34%;\"></td><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">6</font></div></td></tr></table></div><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Significant challenges or delays in the Company&#8217;s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s long-term success.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company&#8217;s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company&#8217;s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2016 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients&#8217; and health care providers&#8217; future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company&#8217;s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company&#8217;s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, &#8220;Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings&#8221; under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company&#8217;s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Foreign Currency Exchange</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">: In fiscal 2016, approximately 47% of the Company&#8217;s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 22% in Europe, 8% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 17% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company&#8217;s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company&#8217;s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s operating results. </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:right;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><div style=\"padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;text-align:-moz-right;\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;width:99.0234375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;margin-left:auto;margin-right:0;\"><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td><td style=\"width:34%;\"></td><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">7</font></div></td></tr></table></div><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company&#8217;s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company&#8217;s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Other Legal, Social and Political Risks</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">.

These subsidiaries operate 119 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:13px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company&#8217;s business or reputation</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data.  The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company&#8217;s sensitive data.  The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company&#8217;s third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to our business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:13px;text-align:left;padding-left:48px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:right;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><div style=\"padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;text-align:-moz-right;\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;width:99.0234375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;margin-left:auto;margin-right:0;\"><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td><td style=\"width:34%;\"></td><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">8</font></div></td></tr></table></div><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><a name=\"s2348C662A99B2E73363149CE90032400\"></a></div><div><br></div><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"padding-top:12px;font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;\"><tr><td style=\"width:72px;\"></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:top\"></td></tr></table>"

The financial services industry has in recent years experienced an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, both in the U.S. and globally. The cumulative effect of the new and currently proposed legislation and regulations could require the Firm to make further changes to its businesses or operations, which could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm and impose additional compliance and other costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firm&#8217;s profitability. These changes could also: limit the products and services that the Firm offers; reduce the liquidity that the Firm is able to offer its clients or counterparties through its market-making activities; impede the Firm&#8217;s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging; require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain </font></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;\"><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:31%;\"></td><td style=\"width:40%;\"></td><td style=\"width:29%;\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:8pt;\">8</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><br></div><div style='display:inline-block; width:100%;'><div style='float:left; width:48%;'><div style=\"line-height:115%;padding-bottom:5px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:10pt;\">businesses; affect the value of assets that the Firm holds; require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products; or otherwise adversely affect the Firm&#8217;s businesses. To the extent that these initiatives have been, or continue to be, imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), the requirements to which the Firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the Firm to restructure further its businesses, or further re-price or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers, which could result in the Firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:115%;padding-bottom:5px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:10pt;\">Authorities in some non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the Firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity. In addition, some non-U.S. regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that seek to impose restrictions on the way the Firm organizes its business units or increase the capital or liquidity requirements on non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm, could hinder the Firm&#8217;s ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs and  thereby decrease the Firm&#8217;s net income. In addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the establishment by non-EU financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the EU, the separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, governance and accountability regimes, conduct of business requirements and restrictions on compensation, could require the Firm to make significant modifications to its non-U.S. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. These differences in implemented or proposed non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could subject the Firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s business, results of operations and profitability.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:115%;padding-bottom:5px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:10pt;\">Recent political developments in the U.S. and abroad have increased the uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which the Firm will operate. Although certain of the proposals being mentioned in the U.S. include the possibility of regulatory reform related to the financial services industry, it is too early to determine the full extent to which these measures will ultimately modify or reduce the regulatory requirements currently imposed on the Firm, and the resulting possible effect on the Firm and its business and operations.

The Firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. The Firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, which increases the Firm&#8217;s operational and compliance costs.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:115%;padding-bottom:5px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:10pt;\">Certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions (including the Firm) that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters. Such admissions and conditions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation, harm to reputation, disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions, and other direct and indirect adverse effects.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:115%;padding-bottom:5px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, U.S. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, including the Firm, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing from those institutions, such as the Firm&#8217;s agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities, and the non-prosecution agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Firm with the U.S. Department of Justice in November 2016 in connection with settlements to resolve various governmental investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. Such resolutions, whether with U.S. or non-U.S. authorities, could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business, or the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, for a period of time (absent the forbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators).</font></div><div style=\"line-height:115%;padding-bottom:5px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:10pt;\">The Firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action. In addition, if the Firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject, or more </font></div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:99.609375%;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;\"><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:34%;\"></td><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td><td style=\"width:33%;\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"overflow:hidden;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#160;</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:bottom;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;\"><div style=\"text-align:right;font-size:8pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Amplitude;font-size:8pt;\">9</font></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div>"

Forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;believe&#8221; and &#8220;plan&#8221; or similar expressions. In particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements.

As we continue to implement our plans, the existing risks we face in our business may be intensified. Our efforts to reduce costs and capital expenditures depend, in part, upon our refranchising efforts, which, in turn, depend upon our ability to select qualified and capable franchisees and licensees. Our cost savings initiatives also depend upon our ability to achieve efficiencies through the consolidation of global, back-office functions. Therefore, if our turnaround-related initiatives are not successful, take longer to complete than initially projected, or are not well executed, or if our cost reduction efforts adversely impact our effectiveness, our business operations, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We will continue to build upon our investments in Experience of the Future (&#8220;EOTF&#8221;), which focus on restaurant modernization and technology and digital engagement in order to transform the restaurant experience.

We are facing sluggish restaurant industry trends in several key markets, including the U.S. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location.

Recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals, including the turnaround plan described above, and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our continued success depends on our System&#8217;s ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, and trends in food sourcing, food preparation and consumer preferences in the IEO segment. In order to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment, we must implement initiatives to adapt at an aggressive pace. There is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">If pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our results depend on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. Further, the promotion of menu offerings may yield results below the desired levels. </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, and we may fail to attract and retain customers. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively. If the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div></div><div style='width:3%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:48%;'><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. Those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the IEO segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of the quick-service category of the IEO segment, our brand and/or our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or portrayals, our brand and our financial results may suffer.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require System-wide coordination and alignment. If we are not effective in addressing social responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In particular, business incidents that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, franchisees or us. If we experience interruptions in our System&#8217;s supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our System&#8217;s operations.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">4</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;McDonald's Corporation </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\">2016 Annual Report</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><br></div><div style='display:inline-block; width:100%;'><div style='float:left; width:48%;'><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System&#8217;s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald&#8217;s of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu evolves. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. If our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us. Our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factors.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. Franchisees&#8217; ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brand&#8217;s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. Our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants, in a timely manner or at all, will depend on various factors, including our ability to timely and effectively select franchisees and/or licensees that meet our rigorous standards and/or to complete transactions on favorable terms and to manage associated risks. It will also depend on the performance of our franchisees, and whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div></div><div style='width:3%; float:left;'>&#160;</div><div style='float:right; width:48%;'><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success.

Increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our Company-operated restaurants could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins.  Similar concerns apply to our franchisees.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the McDonald's System and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">The profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. Any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. We can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:4px;text-align:left;text-indent:36px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We encounter differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald&#8217;s restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System's success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System&#8217;s ability to leverage operating successes across markets.

In the short term, the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting depression in those exchange rates may continue.

The risks below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company presently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. The Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This Form&#160;10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company&#8217;s results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it faces described below and elsewhere. See &#8220;Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results&#8221; below.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, its business would be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the Company&#8217;s marketing of human health products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering products that it has introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing and sale of its products. The Company seeks patents covering each of its products in each of the markets where it intends to sell the products and where meaningful patent protection is available.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Even if the Company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent its patents and patent applications. It is important for the Company&#8217;s business to defend successfully the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for its products. The Company is often involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third parties of infringement against the Company. The Company defends its patents both within and outside the United States, including by filing claims of infringement against other parties. See Item&#160;8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; Note&#160;10. &#8220;Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities&#8221; below. In particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file Abbreviated NDAs with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of the Company&#8217;s products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by the Company. The Company normally responds by defending its patent, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Patent litigation and other challenges to the Company&#8217;s patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the Company of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third-party patents may prevent the Company from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations. Further, court decisions relating to other companies&#8217; patents, potential legislation relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives may result in a more general weakening of intellectual property protection.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">If one or more important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available and, in the case of certain products, such a loss could result in a material non-cash impairment charge. The Company&#8217;s results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until the Company has successfully launched commercially successful replacement products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">A chart listing the patent protection for certain of the Company&#8217;s marketed products, and U.S. patent protection for candidates under review and Phase 3 candidates is set forth above in Item&#160;1. &#8220;Business &#8212; Patents, Trademarks and Licenses.&#8221;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">As the Company&#8217;s products lose market exclusivity, the Company generally experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for its products for some period of time. Loss of patent protection for one of the Company&#8217;s products typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of sales for that product, as lower priced generic versions of that drug become available. In the case of products that contribute significantly to the Company&#8217;s sales, the loss of market exclusivity can have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.

As a result of the Company&#8217;s dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the Company&#8217;s product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company&#8217;s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and the Company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the Company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that have lost patent protection.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Like other major pharmaceutical companies, in order to remain competitive, the Company must continue to launch new products each year. Expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the Company&#8217;s future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products which it may develop through joint ventures and products which it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. To accomplish this, the Company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, both through its own dedicated resources and through various collaborations with third parties. There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs. As a result, there is a high risk that funds invested by the Company in research programs will not generate financial returns. This risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. To bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">For a description of the research and development process, see Item&#160;1. &#8220;Business &#8212; Research and Development&#8221; above. Each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the Company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals, therefore, the Company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: pre-clinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire compounds, product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. The Company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flow, financial position and prospects.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">19</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#sBEDC14A8AAE556648C376C63A4B3EBEC\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company&#8217;s success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or fail to succeed for numerous reasons, including the following:</font></div><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"padding-top:8px;font-family:Times New Roman;

In the United States, the FDA is of particular importance to the Company, as it administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. Regulation outside the United States also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, cost reduction. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion to require additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Even if the Company is successful in developing new products, it will not be able to market any of those products unless and until it has obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where it proposes to market the new products. Once obtained, the Company must maintain approval as long as it plans to market its new products in each jurisdiction where approval is required. The Company&#8217;s failure to obtain approval, significant delays in the approval process, or its failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction will prevent it from selling the new products in that jurisdiction until approval is obtained, if ever.

Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs also have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general that have negatively affected the sales of such products. In addition, increased scrutiny of the outcomes of clinical trials has led to increased volatility in market reaction. Further, these matters often attract litigation and, even where the basis for the litigation is groundless, considerable resources may be needed to respond.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, following the wake of product withdrawals and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the FDA, the EMA and Japan&#8217;s Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency have increased their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on advertising and promotion and, in particular, direct-to-consumer advertising.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of the Company&#8217;s products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require the Company to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes. Further, in the current environment in which all pharmaceutical companies operate, the Company is at risk for product liability and consumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to its products, research and/or marketing activities.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company faces intense competition from lower cost-generic products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In general, the Company faces increasing competition from lower-cost generic products. The patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths and durations. In addition, in some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the United States or in the EU. In the United States and the EU, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic and biosimilar products. Although it is the Company&#8217;s policy to actively protect its patent rights, generic challenges to the Company&#8217;s products can arise at any time, and the Company&#8217;s patents may not prevent the emergence of generic competition for its products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing the Company&#8217;s sales of that product. Availability of generic substitutes for the Company&#8217;s drugs may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Any such proposal that is enacted into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the Company&#8217;s sales and, potentially, its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company faces intense competition from competitors&#8217; products which, in addition to other factors, could in certain circumstances lead to non-cash impairment charges.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company&#8217;s products face intense competition from competitors&#8217; products. This competition may increase as new products enter the market. In such an event, the competitors&#8217; products may be safer or more effective, more convenient to use or more effectively marketed and sold than the Company&#8217;s products. Alternatively, in the case of generic competition, including the generic availability of competitors&#8217; branded products, they may be equally safe and effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than the Company&#8217;s products. As a result, if the Company fails to maintain its competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects. In addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively impact product cash flows, the Company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">21</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#sBEDC14A8AAE556648C376C63A4B3EBEC\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The Company faces pricing pressure with respect to its products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company faces increasing pricing pressure globally and, particularly in mature markets, from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include (i)&#160;practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, (ii)&#160;U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price transparency. Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, in the U.S., larger customers may, in the future, ask for and receive higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. The Company must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In order to provide information about the Company&#8217;s pricing practices, the Company recently posted &#160;on its website&#160;its first Pricing Action Transparency Report for the United States for the years 2010 - 2016. The report provides the Company&#8217;s average annual list price and net price increases across the Company&#8217;s U.S. portfolio dating back to 2010.&#160; The report shows that the Company&#8217;s average annual net price increases (after taking sales deductions such as rebates, discounts and returns into account) across the U.S. human health portfolio have been in the low to mid-single digits since 2010. &#160;Additionally, the weighted average annual discount rate has been steadily increasing over time, reflecting the competitive market for branded medicines and the impact of the ACA. In 2016, the Company&#8217;s gross U.S. sales were reduced by 40.9% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Outside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Consequently, in those markets, the Company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company expects pricing pressures to increase in the future.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The health care industry in the United States will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political action.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the health care system are considered by Congress and state legislatures. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In 2010, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in the form of the ACA. Various insurance market reforms have advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. With respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a 50% point of service discount to Medicare Part&#160;D beneficiaries when they are in the Medicare Part&#160;D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called &#8220;donut hole&#8221;). Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are now required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. The total annual industry fee was $3.0 billion in 2016 and will increase to $4.0 billion in 2017. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">On January 21, 2016, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the Medicaid rebate final rule that implements provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. The impact of changes resulting from the issuance of the rule is not material to Merck, at this time. However, the Company is still awaiting guidance from CMS on two aspects of the rule that were deferred for later implementation. These include a definition of what constitutes a product &#8216;line extension&#8217; and a delay in the participation of the U.S. Territories in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program until April&#160;1, 2020. The Company will evaluate the financial impact of these two elements when they become effective.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">22</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#sBEDC14A8AAE556648C376C63A4B3EBEC\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company cannot predict the likelihood of future changes in the health care industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular, or what impact they may have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">All aspects of the Company&#8217;s business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, pricing, sales, litigation and intellectual property rights, are subject to extensive legislation and regulation.

However, there is no guarantee that the Company&#8217;s efforts to expand sales in these markets will succeed. Some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care. In order for the Company to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy, it must attract and retain qualified personnel. The Company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets. In addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and the Company cannot offset the devaluations, the Company&#8217;s financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, in China, commercial and economic conditions may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s growth prospects in that market. While the Company continues to believe that China represents an important growth opportunity, these events, coupled with heightened scrutiny of the health care industry, may continue to have an impact on product pricing and market access generally. The Company anticipates that the reported inquiries made by various governmental authorities involving multinational pharmaceutical companies in China may continue.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;text-indent:60px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">For all these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks.

Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these applications and systems through intentional or accidental means could impact key business processes. Cyber-attacks against the Company&#8217;s applications and systems could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure of critical operations. Misuse of these applications and systems could result in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade secrets and other confidential business information. The Company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes; the use of which can create new risks. Although the aggregate impact on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the Company has been the target of events of this nature and expects them to continue. The Company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of Company systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats.

Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. This cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. MCOs have recently introduced additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing, and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts. Private health insurance companies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. payer market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, biopharmaceutical companies may face greater </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:center;font-size:9pt;\"><div style=\"padding-left:0px;text-indent:0px;line-height:normal;padding-top:10px;\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:615px;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:left;\"><tr><td colspan=\"3\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:284px;\"></td><td style=\"width:104px;\"></td><td style=\"width:226px;\"></td></tr><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;border-top:1px dotted #0093d0;\"><div style=\"text-align:right;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">Pfizer Inc.</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;border-left:1px dotted #0093d0;border-top:1px dotted #0093d0;\"><div style=\"text-align:center;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;\">2016 Form 10-K</font></div></td><td style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding-left:2px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:2px;border-left:1px dotted #0093d0;border-top:1px dotted #0093d0;\"><div style=\"text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">11</font></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;color:#0093d0;\" href=\"#sA015DE50F3A25E3AAA74B4D3ACB73EB2\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:8pt;color:#0093d0;\">TABLE OF CONTENTS</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">pricing pressure from private third-party payers, who will continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">GENERIC COMPETITION</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products around the world, and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. The date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our products, or upon the &#8220;at-risk&#8221; launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time, which can adversely affect our business.

Our licensing and collaboration partners also face challenges by generic drug manufacturers to patents covering several of their products that may impact our licenses or co-promotion rights to such products.

The introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. Competitive product launches have occurred in recent years, and certain potentially competitive products are in various stages of development, some of which have been filed for approval with the FDA and with regulatory authorities in other countries.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products that compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generic and biosimilar manufacturers. The ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before anticipated generic or biosimilar market formation is important to that product&#8217;s profitability. Prices for products typically decline, sometimes dramatically, following generic market formation, and as additional companies receive approvals to market that product, competition intensifies. If a company&#8217;s generic or biosimilar product can be &#8220;first-to-market&#8221; such that its only competition is the branded drug for a period of time, higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market. With increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market, the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance. Our success will depend on our ability to bring new products to market quickly.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE PRODUCTS</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We recorded direct product revenues of more than $1 billion for each of eight biopharmaceutical products: </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">, </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Lyrica</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">, </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Enbrel</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">, </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Ibrance</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">, </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Lipitor</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">, </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Viagra</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">, </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Sutent </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">and the </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Premarin</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">&#32;family of products, as well as more than $1 billion in Alliance revenues (primarily </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;\">Eliquis</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">) in 2016. Those products and Alliance revenues accounted for 43% of our total revenues in 2016. If these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant. Patents covering several of our best-selling medicines have recently expired or will expire in the next few years (including some of our billion-dollar and previously billion-dollar products), and patents covering a number of our best-selling medicines are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges.

Our product lines must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their market exclusivity, as well as to provide for earnings growth. Our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new indications for existing products that address unmet medical needs and receive reimbursement from payers, either through internal R&amp;D or through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures or licensing or other arrangements with third parties. However, balancing current growth, investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains a major challenge. The average costs of product development continue to rise, as do the regulatory requirements in many therapeutic areas, which may affect the number of candidates funded as well as the sustainability of the R&amp;D portfolio. Our ongoing investments in new product introductions and in R&amp;D for new products and existing product extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Additionally, our R&amp;D investment plans and resources may not be correctly matched between science and markets, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic segments, product classes, geographic markets and/or in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities in order to deliver a robust pipeline could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. Further, even if the areas with the greatest market attractiveness are identified, the science may not work for any given program despite the significant investment required for R&amp;D, and the commercial potential of the product may not be as competitive as expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdles in terms of access and reimbursement.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We continue to strengthen our global R&amp;D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&amp;D to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time.

However, each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resources required to demonstrate benefit, the increased complexity of development and the potential delays to approval of the lead indication.

A counterfeit Pfizer medicine, therefore, is one manufactured by someone other than Pfizer, but which appears to be the same as an authentic Pfizer medicine. The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is a significant and growing industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the widespread use of the Internet, which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicines can be advertised, purchased and delivered to individual patients; the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit medicines; the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under-regulated wholesalers and repackagers; the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facilities as counterfeit medicines are increasingly delivered direct to customers in small parcel packages; and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters. Further, laws against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country, and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, in some countries, pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not a crime; in others, it may result in only minimal sanctions. In addition, those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicines use complex transport routes in order to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Pfizer&#8217;s global reputation makes its medicines prime targets for counterfeiting organizations. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured&#8212;often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites&#8212;as well as the lack of regulation of their contents. Failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines, which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain, could adversely impact our business, by, among other things, causing the loss of patient confidence in the Pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicines, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We undertake significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit medicines, including, among other things, working with the FDA and other regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of medicines and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters; assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy our products and easier for patients and healthcare providers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicines; implementing business practices designed to protect patient health; promoting public policies intended to hinder counterfeiting; working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit medicines; and working collaboratively with wholesalers, pharmacies, customs offices, and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage, monitor distribution channels, and improve surveillance of distributors and repackagers.

Pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Additionally, efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products could adversely affect our business if implemented. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In certain international markets, such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada and South Korea, governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health technology assessments), or other means of cost control, particularly under recent global financing pressures. As a result, we expect that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will continue.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">The adoption of restrictive price controls in new jurisdictions or more restrictive ones in existing jurisdictions, failure to obtain timely or adequate government-approved pricing or formulary placement where required for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue.

The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain and involves a high degree of risk and cost. Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take many years. Drug candidates can and do fail at any stage of the process, including as the result of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data. There can be no assurance regarding our ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical and clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, or as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products, which will depend on the assessment by regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted. Decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products. There is no assurance that we will be able to address the comments in complete response letters received by us with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of the FDA, that any of our late stage pipeline products will receive regulatory approval and/or be commercially successful or that recently approved products will be approved in other markets and/or be commercially successful. There is also a risk that we may not adequately address existing regulatory agency findings concerning the adequacy of our regulatory compliance processes and systems or implement sustainable processes and procedures to maintain regulatory compliance and to address future regulatory agency findings, should they occur. In addition, there are risks associated with interim data, including the risk that final results of studies for which interim data have been provided and/or additional clinical trials may be different from (including less favorable than) the interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">There are many considerations that can affect the marketing of our products around the world.

Further, claims and concerns about safety and efficacy can result in a negative impact on product sales, product recalls or withdrawals, and/or consumer fraud, product liability and other litigation and claims. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy, with regulatory authorities increasingly focused on product safety and the risk/benefit profile of products as they relate to already-approved products, has resulted in a more challenging, expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to requests for, among other things, additional clinical trials prior to granting approval or increased post-approval requirements, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">In addition, failure to put in place adequate controls and/or resources for effective collection, reporting and management of adverse events from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, in compliance with current and evolving regulatory requirements could result in risks to patient safety, regulatory actions and risks to product sales.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">The FDA, along with other regulatory agencies around the world, has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications, which has delayed approvals of new generic products.

The results generated in these Phase 4 trials could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. Regulatory agencies in countries outside the U.S. often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements.

Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur judgments, enter into settlements of claims or revise our expectations regarding the outcomes of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Claims against our patents include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes.

Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information demands from government authorities, and been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by governmental authorities, as well as by consumers and private payers. In some instances, we have incurred significant expense, civil payments, fines and other adverse consequences as a result of these claims, actions and inquiries. For example, these claims, actions and inquiries may relate to alleged failures to accurately interpret or identify or prevent non-compliance with the laws and regulations associated with the dissemination of product information (approved and unapproved), potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation.

We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our branded products, using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be granted on a timely basis. Similarly, any term extensions that we seek may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws. We may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country&#8217;s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights, and the extent to which certain sovereigns may seek to engage in a policy of routine compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property as a result of local political pressure or in the case of national emergencies. In countries that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity, mechanisms exist permitting some form of challenge to our patents by competitors or generic drug marketers prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic companies are increasingly employing aggressive strategies, such as &#8220;at risk&#8221; launches to challenge our patent rights. Most of the suits by generic drug manufacturers involve claims that patents covering our products, processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. We are also party to other patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for alleged delay of generic entry. Further, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.&#160; </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Likewise, in the U.S. and other countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal remedies in some countries may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">A properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model.

To achieve a &#8220;first-to-market&#8221; or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilars, we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party.

We rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, &#8220;hacktivists,&#8221; nation states and others. As a global pharmaceutical company, our systems are subject to frequent attacks. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">:</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">The success of our acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor, Medivation and AstraZeneca&#8217;s small molecule anti-infectives business will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from combining these businesses with Pfizer. We, for example, may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with the acquisition of Hospira, or such cost savings within the expected time frame. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from the acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor and Medivation may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction. Expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges regularly adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates, including those acquired in these acquisitions. Hospira, for example, has experienced manufacturing disruptions, device remediations and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues, including receiving a warning letter from the FDA in February 2017 communicating FDA</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;\">&#8217;</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">s view that certain violations of cGMP regulations exist at Hospira</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;\">&#8217;</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">s manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas. Manufacturing problems, as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from Hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">OTHER RISKS:</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;color:#00497f;font-weight:bold;\">THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\"><br></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt;\">Like all businesses, we are exposed to both global and industry-specific economic conditions. Governments, corporations and insurance companies, which provide insurance benefits to patients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on access to medicines, potentially causing patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. Government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health technology assessments), or other means of cost control. Examples include Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and a number of other international markets.

As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the U.K. pound, the Canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. If the U.S. dollar were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings.

For IPR&amp;D assets, the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. The nature of the biopharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects in an effort to achieve a successful portfolio of approved products. Our ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory approvals and market acceptance. As such, we expect that many of these IPR&amp;D assets will become impaired and be written off at some time in the future. For goodwill, all reporting units can confront events and circumstances that can lead to a goodwill impairment charge (such as, among other things, unanticipated competition, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a significant adverse change in legal matters or in the business climate and/or a failure to replace the contributions of products that lose exclusivity). Any such charge may be significant. Our other intangible assets, including developed technology rights and brands, face similar risks for impairment and charges related to such assets may be significant as well.

These economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Conditions of the Construction and Aerospace Industries.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">50</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;percent of our consolidated sales in </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">2016</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors. For example, a slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of Otis and UTC Climate, Controls&#160;&amp; Security. In addition, the financial performance of UTC Climate, Controls&#160;&amp; Security can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">50</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;percent of our consolidated sales in </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">2016</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and backlog levels.  Any of these conditions could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Additionally, because a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">2017</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts.  Spare parts sales and aftermarket </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">10</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\" href=\"#s88C7EDE14E4352C47B912FE8383B9CA1\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. A reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The defense industry is also affected by a changing U.S. and global political environment, continued pressure on U.S. and global defense spending and U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. U.S. Government deficit reduction measures, Congressional and executive branch disputes over budgets and debt ceilings and the impact of sequestration have increased market uncertainty and adversely affected our military businesses.  Should these factors continue and overall U.S. Government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and backlog for our military businesses.  One or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out, limited or terminated.  Reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Economic Conditions and Changes in Local Government Regulation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">61</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;percent of our </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">2016</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;total segment sales derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-U.S. operations (especially the commercial businesses and P&amp;W Canada), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. Dollars. Given that the majority of our sales are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the U.S.&#160;Dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in U.S. Dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the U.S. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, and the Polish Zloty). For operating units with U.S.&#160;Dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the U.S.&#160;Dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. To manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S.&#160;Dollar sales. See Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">2016</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;Annual Report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, punitive taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government's adoption of \"buy national\" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. For example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. The contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa and countries in the Middle East, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk.  We expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products.  Emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls.

In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, and May Encounter Difficulties Integrating Acquired Businesses with, or Disposing of Divested Businesses From, Our Current Operations; Therefore, We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of these Acquisitions and Divestitures.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and expect to continue to do so in the future. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target&#8217;s previous activities.  For example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target&#8217;s violation of applicable laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or  other anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.  We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. We also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. Our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.  The success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our Debt Levels and Related Debt Service Obligations Could Have Negative Consequences; Our Ability to Access Debt May Be Affected by Changes in Global Capital Markets, Our Financial Performance or Outlook or Our Credit Ratings.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity.

The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Of particular note, Pratt &amp; Whitney is currently producing the PurePower&#174; PW1000G Geared TurboFan engine to power various aircraft, including the A320neo family of aircraft, which entered into service in January 2016.&#160;The level of orders received for the PurePower&#174; family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short timeframe are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If our production ramp-up efforts are delayed or if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, we may not meet customers&#8217; production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including penalties that could be assessed under existing contractual provisions. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. For example, certain of our aerospace products are incorporated into larger systems and end products manufactured by our customers.  These systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace.  </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings.

We or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products.

Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. Some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. In addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts.  Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. The possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete.  In addition, the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our Business May Be Affected by Government Contracting Risks.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Most of our government contracts are fixed-price contracts.  While fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues.  U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. We are now, and believe that in light of the current U.S. Government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of U.S. Government investigations relating to certain of our U.S. Government contracts. Such U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. Government contracting or of export privileges.  For instance, if  we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any U.S. Government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the U.S. Government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. Government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. Government could fine and debar us from new U.S. Government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct.  The U.S. Government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud.  Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports, which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, including because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld.  Some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Exports of Certain of Our Products Are Subject to Various Export Control Regulations and May Require Authorization From the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;\">or</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">&#32;the U.S. Department of the Treasury or Regulatory Agencies of Other Countries.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations.

Any failures by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity or restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. Any changes in export or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue.  Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">14</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\" href=\"#s88C7EDE14E4352C47B912FE8383B9CA1\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">We Are Subject to Litigation, Environmental, Product Safety and Other Legal and Compliance Risks.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs.  </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">At times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries&#8217; current or former operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees or residents in the area and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. Product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services.  For a description of current material legal proceedings, see \"Legal Proceedings\" in in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Annual Report. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and corruption laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the FCPA or similar laws. As a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Additional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposures Could Affect Our Future Profitability.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various international jurisdictions.

Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. In addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time.

These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. We may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;padding-top:16px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected By Attacks on Information Technology Infrastructure and Other Cyber-based and Business Disruptions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:48px;font-size:11pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:11pt;\"></font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third party information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) attacks on or failures of such infrastructure,  compromises to its physical security, as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature.

These statements are intended to take advantage of the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report and, except as required by law; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings or communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">If we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs in an effective manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Through our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based benefits products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage medical costs. In this regard, federal and state regulatory requirements obligate our commercial, Medicare Advantage and certain state-based Medicaid health plans to maintain minimum MLRs, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain price increases for our products. In addition, our OptumHealth business negotiates capitation arrangements with commercial third-party payers. Under the typical capitation arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payer&#8217;s premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member. If we fail to predict accurately, price for or manage the costs of providing care to our capitated members, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically at a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">13</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s9D808ADDFE6971E3DD0F2FBC46527489\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2016 medical costs for commercial insured products were 1% higher, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2016 would have been reduced by approximately $240 million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment, reinsurance or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States and other countries where we do business. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. For example, states require periodic financial reports and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements. Health plans and insurance companies are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulations and some of our activities may be subject to other health care-related regulations and requirements, including those relating to PPOs, MCOs, UR and TPA-related regulations and licensure requirements. Some of our UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses hold or provide services related to government contracts and are subject to U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. self-referral, anti-kickback, medical necessity, risk adjustment, false claims and other laws and regulations governing government contractors and the use of government funds. In addition, under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and other payers such as consumer operated and oriented plans (co-ops) established under the ACA. Any such assessment could expose our insurance entities and other insurers to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company&#8217;s claims through state guaranty associations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Certain of our businesses provide products or services to various government agencies. Our relationships with these government agencies are subject to the terms of contracts that we hold with the agencies and to laws and regulations regarding government contracts. Among others, certain laws and regulations restrict or prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or potential conflict of interest. These laws may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work, thereby materially and adversely affecting our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations, which are distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including, for example, state telemedicine regulations, debt collection laws, banking regulations, distributor and producer licensing requirements, state corporate practice of medicine doctrines, fee-splitting rules, health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements, some of which could impact our relationships with physicians, hospitals and customers. These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted margins, or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change, and the integration into our businesses of entities that we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us. The broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our business could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We must also obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services, increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions. For example, premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government. Additionally, we must submit data on all proposed rate increases to HHS for monitoring purposes on many of our products. Geographic and product expansions may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approvals could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Certain of our businesses operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or conduct business. These regulatory regimes encompass, among other matters, local and cross-border taxation, licensing, tariffs, intellectual property, investment, capital (including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirements), management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">14</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s9D808ADDFE6971E3DD0F2FBC46527489\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">transfers) that vary by jurisdiction. We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States, increasing our exposure to non-U.S. regulatory regimes.&#160;For example, our UnitedHealthcare Brazil business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals, managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators, including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans, the Ag&#234;ncia Nacional de Sa&#250;de Suplementar, whose approach to the interpretation, implementation and enforcement of industry regulations could differ from the approach taken by U.S. regulators. In addition, our non-U.S. businesses and operations are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the FCPA, which prohibits offering, promising, providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The health care industry is also regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The ACA could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct business and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Due to its complexity and continued uncertainty, the ACA&#8217;s impact remains difficult to predict and could adversely affect us. The ACA includes specific reforms for the individual and small group marketplace, including guaranteed availability of coverage, adjusted community rating requirements (which include elimination of health status and gender rating factors), essential health benefit requirements (resulting in benefit changes for many members) and actuarial value requirements resulting in expanded benefits or reduced member cost sharing (or a combination of both) for many policyholders. In addition, if we do not maintain certain MLRs, we are required to rebate ratable portions of our premiums to our customers. These requirements can cause significant disruptions in local health care markets and adjustments to our business, all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the number of  individuals who gain coverage under the ACA varies from our expectations, if the demand for the ACA related products and capabilities offered by our Optum businesses is less than anticipated or if our costs are greater than anticipated.</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Trump Administration and Congressional Leaders have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the ACA. We cannot predict if the ACA will be modified, repealed or replaced, but changes to this law could materially impact our operating results, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">As a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs, CHIP and our TRICARE contract with the DoD, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or, as is a typical feature of many government contracts, termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments.&#160;Although we have adjusted members&#8217; benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:0px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">15</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s9D808ADDFE6971E3DD0F2FBC46527489\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br></font></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Under the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system that provides various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans that meet certain quality star ratings at the local plan level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among other things, quality of care, preventative services, chronic illness management and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect our membership levels, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, under the ACA, Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement MMP managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. Health plan participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval of specified care delivery models and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. Any changes in standards or care delivery models that apply to government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the MMP demonstration programs for dually eligible beneficiaries, or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements&#160;or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs, including adjusting monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as, for Medicare Part D plans, risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs predicted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process. For example, our UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us. CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers, and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit. Such audits have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans, fines, corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We have been and may in the future become involved in routine, regular and special governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model, our chart review programs and related processes. Such investigations, audits or reviews sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers that, among other allegations, we failed to disclose certain business practices or, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government. Governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments could lead to government actions, which could result in adverse publicity, the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">If we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers.

Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery and specialty pharmacies, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including potential new regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our pharmacy care services businesses would be materially and adversely affected by our inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Disruptions at any of our home delivery or specialty pharmacies due to an accident or an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to ERISA.

In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by significant merger and acquisition activity that has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both among our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals). Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase our customer base, improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or maintain or increase profitability. Additionally, new direct-to-consumer business models from competing businesses may make it more difficult for us to directly engage consumers in the selection and management of their health care benefits, health care usage, and in the effective navigation of the health care system we may be challenged by new technologies and market entrants that could disrupt our existing relationship with health plan enrollees in these areas. Our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether in-network or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes that may be costly, distract managements&#8217; attention and result in negative publicity.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, accountable care organizations; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider, under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances, the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The success of certain businesses, including OptumHealth and UnitedHealthcare Brazil, depend on maintaining satisfactory physician employment relationships.

These matters have included or could in the future include matters related to health care benefits coverage and payment claims (including disputes with enrollees, customers and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), tort claims (including claims related to the delivery of health care services, such as medical malpractice by health care practitioners who are employed by us, have contractual relationships with us, or serve as providers to our managed care networks), whistleblower claims (including claims under the False Claims Act or similar statutes), contract and labor disputes, tax claims and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers. In addition, we operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States, where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States, and therefore subject to dispute by customers, government authorities or others. We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, it is possible that the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We cannot predict the outcome of significant legal actions in which we are involved and are incurring expenses in resolving these matters.

For example, we have a strategic alliance with AARP under which we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance to AARP members and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries.&#160;If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Success in completing acquisitions is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment, or otherwise leveraging its operations, which may present challenges that are different from those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult for us to manage.

In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. Our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology may not be successful.

Even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a purchase transaction (those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process. Consequently, changes to these fees, whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Interchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules and practices. For example, in 2011, in accordance with the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. This amounted to a significant reduction in the average system-wide interchange reimbursement fees received by large issuers. The Dodd-Frank Act also limited issuers' and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacted our business. In 2015, the E.U.&#8217;s IFR placed an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fees for both domestic and cross border transactions (30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively), significantly reducing the fees received by E.U. issuers. E.U. Member States have the ability to further restrict these interchange levels within their territories. More recently, in September 2016, Argentina's Senate approved a bill to reduce existing caps on the merchant discount rate charged by acquirers to 1.5% for credit transactions and zero for debit transactions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">In addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fees, a number of regulators impose restrictions on other aspects of our payments business. For example, government regulations or pressure may require or allow other networks to be supported by Visa products or services or to have the other network's functionality or brand marks on our products. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, they have  also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. In addition, the E.U.&#8217;s requirement to separate scheme and processing adds costs and could impact the efficient integration of Visa Europe; the execution of our commercial, innovation and product strategies; our ability to provide effective customer service; and the amount of data available for use in fraud and risk systems and loyalty services.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We are also subject to central bank oversight in the U.K. and the E.U. This oversight could result in new governance, reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital or credit risk management requirements. We could also be required to adopt policies and practices designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including increased requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally. Increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criteria for financial institution participation in, and access to our payments system. Additionally, regulators in other jurisdictions are considering or adopting approaches based on similar regulatory principles.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Regulators around the world increasingly take note of each other&#8217;s approaches to regulating the payments industry. Consequently, a development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in another. The risks created by a new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. The U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the E.U. IFR are developments with such potential, as are approaches taken by regulators in Australia, Canada and other countries. See </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;of this report. Similarly, new regulations involving one product offering may prompt regulators to extend the regulations to other product offerings. For example, credit payments could become subject to the same regulation as debit payments. Additionally, regulation in an individual country could continue and expand. For example, in Australia the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) initially capped credit interchange, but subsequently capped debit interchange as well.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees to consumers, making our products less appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;15</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s0058E4C0F39258FE9EAC30447D86E7BE\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">payments systems or forms of payment. In addition, in an effort to reduce the expense of their card programs, some issuers and acquirers have obtained, and may continue to obtain, incentives from us and reductions in the fees that we charge, which may directly impact our revenues. For these reasons, increased global regulation of the payments industry may make our products less desirable, diminish our ability to compete, reduce our transaction volumes and harm our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:18px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Government-imposed restrictions on payment systems may prevent us from competing against providers in certain countries</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Governments in various jurisdictions, such as in Asia and the Gulf Cooperation Countries in the Middle East, protect certain domestic payment card networks, brands and processors. These governments may impose regulatory requirements that favor domestic providers or that mandate domestic payments processing be done entirely in that country, which would prevent us from overseeing the end-to-end processing of certain transactions. In China, for example, UnionPay continues to enjoy advantages over other international networks, remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transactions and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark. Though the Chinese State Council has announced that international schemes, such as Visa would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, the full implementation guidelines for BCCI&#8217;s have yet to be finalized.

National laws that protect domestic processing may increase our costs, decrease the number of Visa products issued or processed, impede us from utilizing our global processing capabilities and control the quality of the services supporting our brands, restrict our activities, force us to leave countries or prevent us from entering new markets, all of which could harm our ability to operate our business, maintain or increase our revenues globally and extend our global brands.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:18px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations.

The impact of these regulations on us (and on our clients and other third parties) could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules or require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules, and it may increase our compliance costs and reduce our revenue opportunities. We may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa Rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and can reduce our revenue opportunities. Further, as regulations change, they may affect our existing contractual arrangements.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">If widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services and fees, and other important aspects of our business in the various regions where we operate. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, litigation and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process and our revenue; negatively impact our brands and our competitive positioning; and limit the types of products and services that we offer, the countries in which our products are used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:18px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in the tax laws</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;16</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s0058E4C0F39258FE9EAC30447D86E7BE\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.

We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.K.&#8217;s HM Revenue &amp; Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in the future. Relevant tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In addition, changes in existing laws, such as recent proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform or those resulting from the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, may also increase our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results.

In addition, settlement terms, judgments or pressures resulting from legal proceedings or investigations may require us, to modify the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, revise the Visa Rules or the way in which we enforce our rules, modify our fees or pricing, or modify the way we do business, which may harm our business. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation asserted against them, even if Visa is not a defendant.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">For certain litigation matters like the U.S. covered litigation and the VE territory covered litigation, which are described in </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Note 3&#8212;U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;and </font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;\">Note 20&#8212;Legal Matters</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">, we have certain protections provided for in the respective retrospective responsibility plans.

As technology evolves, new competitors emerge and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other closed-loop payments systems, and alternative payment providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, emerging payment providers and other digital and technology companies. Many of these providers have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channels, and are seeking to expand into other channels that compete with or replace our products and services.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">Additionally, some of our competitors may develop substantially better technology, more widely adopted delivery channels or have greater financial resources.

Government actions or initiatives such as the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act or the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s Faster Payments initiatives may provide them with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages from these business models. Similarly, regulation in Europe under PSD2 and in the U.K. through the PSR may require us to open up access to, and allow participation in, our network to additional participants, and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitors. We also run the risk of disintermediation due to factors such as emerging technologies, including mobile payments, alternate payment credentials, other ledger technologies or payment forms, and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreements between entities that prefer not to use our payments network for processing payments. For example, merchants could process transactions directly with issuers, or processors could process transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve.

While we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. Further, in certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our operating revenues is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">In order to stay competitive, we offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, enter new market segments and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. These include up-front cash payments, fee discounts and rebates, credits, performance-based incentives, marketing and other support payments that impact our revenues and profitability. In addition, we offer incentives to certain merchants or acquirers to win routing preference in situations where other network functionality is enabled on our products and there is a choice of network routing options. Market pressures on providing incentives, fee discounts and rebates could moderate our growth. If we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiatives in other areas of our business or increase our volumes in other ways to offset the financial impact of these incentives, fee discounts and rebates, it may harm our net revenues and profits.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, it may be difficult or costly for us to acquire or conduct business with financial institutions or merchants that have longstanding exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These financial institutions or merchants may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing clients or merchants. In addition, if there is a consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest clients or co-brand partners by a financial institution client or merchant with a strong relationship with one of our competitors, it could result in our business shifting to a competitor, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:18px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Merchants' and processors' continued push to lower acceptance costs and challenge industry practices could harm our business</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We rely in part on merchants and their relationships with our clients to maintain and expand the acceptance of Visa products. Certain large retail merchants have been exercising their influence in the global payments system to attempt to lower their acceptance costs by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory enforcement, filing lawsuits and in some cases, refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses and issuers may decrease their issuance of our products. In the U.S., the cost of payment card acceptance has emerged in the context of payment security. A number of merchant trade associations claim that EMV cards without PIN cardholder verification are not worth the investment. The October 2015 liability shift and ongoing transition to EMV resulted in calls for a PIN verification mandate. More recently, U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors have expressed concerns regarding the EMV certification process.

Additionally, some merchants and processors have pushed for changes to industry practices and our requirements for Visa acceptance at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transaction, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adversely impact consumers' usage of our products, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation, increase our compliance and litigation expenses, and harm our business.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:18px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">We depend on relationships with our financial institution clients, acquirers, merchants and other third parties</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with customers and merchants to support our programs and services and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. Our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brands and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The increased use or popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with large technology and financial institution companies could result in consumer confusion or brand disintermediation and decrease the value of our brand. In addition, our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data security breaches, compliance failures, negative perception of our industry or the industries of our clients, actions by clients or other third parties, such as sponsorship partners, that do not reflect our views or are inconsistent with our own business practices, and fraudulent or other illegal activity using our payment products.

In addition, almost half of our operating revenues are earned outside the U.S. International transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Therefore, adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or slowdown of global trade, could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, government and corporate spending, which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics or other local or global health issues like the Zika virus, political uncertainties like Brexit, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, and natural disasters could impact our operations, our clients and our activities in a particular location.

In certain instances, we may indemnify issuers or acquirers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. This indemnification creates settlement risk for us due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. Concurrent settlement failures involving more than one of our largest clients, several of our smaller clients or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could cause us to exceed our available financial resources, which could negatively impact our financial position. Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment. This could expose us to significant losses and harm our business.

(commonly referred to as Brexit). The U.K. government is working towards triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which will commence the official E.U. withdrawal process. Uncertainty over the terms of the U.K.&#8217;s departure from the E.U. could harm our business and financial results. In addition, other E.U. member countries may consider referendums regarding their E.U. membership. Any of these events, along with any political changes that may occur as a result of Brexit, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe. As a result, our operations in the U.K., resulting from the recent acquisition of Visa Europe, as well as our global operations, could be impacted.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and other currencies may harm our results of operations as the local currency results of our international operations may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Uncertainty over Brexit and currency fluctuations could also impact our clients, who may curtail or postpone investments in growing their credit portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fees and loyalty programs, or take other actions that harm our volume and revenue.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the U.K. and E.U. We, as well as our clients who have significant operations in the U.K., may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the E.U. and as a result, our Visa Rules and contractual commitments in the U.K. may be impacted. In addition, because we conduct business in and have operations in the U.K., we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate E.U. Member States. These factors may impact our ability to operate in the E.U. and U.K. seamlessly.

In addition to our own initiatives and innovations, we work closely with third parties, including some potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. It is difficult, however, to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted. It is also difficult to predict how these technologies may be regulated. Moreover, some of these new technologies could be subject to intellectual property-related lawsuits or assertions, potentially impacting our development efforts and/or requiring us to obtain licenses.

Our visibility and role in the global payments industry may also put us at a greater risk of being targeted by hackers. In the normal course of our business, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. Additionally, several merchants have encountered substantial cybersecurity breaches and re-breaches affecting their customers, some of whom were Visa account holders. Although these merchant breaches have not had a direct, material impact on us, we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we may be unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attacks to our business.

In addition, any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach, cyber-attack or system failure at one or more of our clients, merchants or other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products, which could harm our payments volume, revenues and future growth prospects. Finally, a breach may also subject Visa to additional regulations or governmental or regulatory investigations, which could result in significant compliance costs, fines or enforcement actions or potential restrictions imposed by regulators on our ability to process transactions.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:12px;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;\">We may experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing systems, which could significantly disrupt our operations; impact our clients and customers; damage our reputation; result in litigation, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, and regulatory fines or penalties; decrease the overall use and acceptance of our products; and be costly, time consuming and difficult to remedy.

In addition, we may make other strategic investments or acquisitions, which like the Visa Europe acquisition are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside our control.

Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions.  Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Failure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing e-commerce investments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications.  As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate.  We plan to increase our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and e-commerce sales (which are included in our calculation of comparable store and club sales with the exception of e-commerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for 12 months) for growth.  The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail channels and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this </font><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" href=\"#s3481E3C2620FEA609FC9D0E39EFA84C3\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Item 1A</font></a><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our e-commerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings.  If we fail to  successfully implement our strategy, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected.  In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">&#32;18</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired e-commerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Operational Risks</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012 or the numerous storm systems in the U.S. in recent years, and could adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses.  Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages.

Our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates.  Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations.  If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim.  Any interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems.  The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe our change management process will mitigate this risk.  If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy.

We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience.  As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today\" and \"Club Pickup\" and in a growing number of locations, \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.

Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors.  In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated.  Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small groups of \"hackers.\"  Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems.  We have in place substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, our information systems and the information stored on such systems.

We require our third-party service providers to do the same.  Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems.

Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations.  If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.  </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in February 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates occurring in February 2016 have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly.  If we cannot offset the increases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit, achieving decreases in our operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017.

Our ability to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms.  Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods.  Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets may also limit our ability to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units in such markets which may adversely impact our financial results.  If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment through opening new units, growing comparable store sales or selective acquisitions, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our Walmart International segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital retail operations, physical retail operations or both.  For example, in fiscal 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. providing for Walmart China to be a preferred retailer on its online-to-offline platform and our Sam's Club business in China to be a flagship store on its marketplace.  Any strategic alliance may not generate the level of e-commerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance.  In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, such as our investment in JD.com, Inc., could materially adversely affect our financial performance.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;\">Financial Risks</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries.

In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates.  Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.

Our operating segments also source goods and services from other countries.  Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.  These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The potential imposition by the U.S. of a border tax or border adjustment tax, new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact a country in which we have operations could result in actions by that country to impose new, or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into such country from the U.S. or elsewhere and could damage the reputations of U.S.-based companies, including us, with customers and others in that country.

Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.  Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.  The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act.

Some of the changes contemplated by the U.S. Congress, like the border tax or border adjustment tax, could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate, the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes, and our overall tax liability, and could reduce our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity, even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which corporate taxable income is taxed.  In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation.  Our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation.

The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified.

The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings.  We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences.

Risk Factors</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following:</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">15</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;\" href=\"#s08418DC4B7345D7786A61A501D275F84\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;\">TABLE OF CONTENTS</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">A decline in economic activity in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. A decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. Recent instability in non-U.S. economies has had some of these and similar impacts on some of our domestic and overseas operations. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets, and recent changes have reduced the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. Economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Our businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. Many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the U.S., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the U.S. Moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home entertainment or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels across the industry, including for a number of our networks. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes, that we will not experience disruption as we respond to the changes, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. As a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products.</font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">16</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;\" href=\"#s08418DC4B7345D7786A61A501D275F84\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;\">TABLE OF CONTENTS</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues. New technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. The unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the Company&#8217;s operations worldwide, despite the Company&#8217;s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">With respect to intellectual property developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems in an effort to prevent intrusion, tampering and theft, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Accordingly, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. If our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">A variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. The environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the U.S., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. These events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. In addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the Company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. A wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. We obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, </font></div><div><br></div><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">17</font></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"><div><div style=\"line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;\"><a style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;\" href=\"#s08418DC4B7345D7786A61A501D275F84\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;\">TABLE OF CONTENTS</font></a></div></div><div><br></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. When insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. The types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise decide to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. In addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer patterns, acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. In recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions and investment in Shanghai Disney Resort. Some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. In any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Past disruptions in the U.S. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. These conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the Company&#8217;s performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. Past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. A similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\">Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;padding-bottom:4px;padding-top:12px;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">We face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities.

Such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.

In addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. These macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements.

As these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

Moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or United States anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses.
