(NYSE: ADT), a leading provider of security and automation solutions for homes and businesses, today reported the results for its fourth quarter and full year 2018. The Company also provided guidance for 2019 and announced a quarterly dividend, dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”), and share buyback.“Completing a successful year for ADT, we delivered a strong fourth quarter and exceeded our financial outlook”, stated Jim DeVries, ADT’s President and CEO. “We continue to demonstrate improvement across key operating metrics and strengthened our leadership in leading-edge home automation through the launch of ADT Command and Control. Moreover, following the December acquisition of Red Hawk, 1which accelerated our expansion into the attractive commercial market, we recently added a new growth platform for our business through the acquisition of LifeShield. LifeShield is a leader in the DIY home security space and will enable us to leverage our brand, scale and unrivaled reputation to compete in the growing DIY market. As we move forward, we will continue to invest in our business and the extraordinary opportunities ahead, capitalizing on the preeminent ADT brand and dedicated team who make us better positioned than ever to build long-term shareholder value.”FOURTH QUARTER 2018 RESULTS(1)(2) Total revenue was $1,185 million, up 7%, or $80 million year-over-year, and includes incremental revenue associated with acquisitions. Monitoring and related services revenue (“M&S revenue”), which comprised $1,040 million of total revenue, was up 3% over the same period last year. The growth in M&S revenue was attributable to an increase in monthly recurring revenue, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition. In addition to M&S revenue, installation and other revenue was up by an additional $52 million from last year, primarily driven by commercial revenues as a result of the successful execution of our commercial growth strategy.Recurring monthly revenue (RMR), a primary driver of M&S revenue, grew by 2%, or 4% including Red Hawk, in the quarter over the same period last year. Net growth in our core US residential and commercial operations was offset by a decline in RMR attributable to our Canadian business.The Company reported a net loss of $149 million, compared to prior year’s net income of $638 million.  The increase in net loss was primarily due to the prior year’s income tax benefit of $725 million related to Tax Reform and a goodwill impairment loss of $88 million in 2018 due to underperformance of our Canadian business. Diluted earnings per share was $(0.20) versus $0.99 in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share before special items was $(0.04) versus $(0.06) in the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA was $614 million, up 3%, or $15 million year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA growth was a result of higher M&S revenue combined with higher revenue from transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers, partially offset by the associated costs and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding items outside of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.Adjusted Net Income was $101 million versus $76 million in the same period last year, an increase of $25 million. The increase in Adjusted Net Income was largely driven by year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA and decrease in cash interest.Trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition improved 40 basis points year-over-year, ending at 13.3%.  The improvement was due to lower voluntary disconnects and lower disconnects due to non-paying customers.Trailing twelve-month customer revenue payback improved to 2.4 years from 2.5 years in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The improvement was a result of year-over-year growth in RMR additions combined with more efficient subscriber acquisition spend.2FULL YEAR 2018 RESULTS(1)(2) On a full year basis, the Company reported total revenue of $4,582 million, up 6%, or $266 million year-over-year, which includes incremental revenue associated with acquisitions. M&S revenue was $4,110 million, and installation and other revenue was $472 million, up 2% and 65%, or $81 million and $186 million, respectively.Net loss was $609 million, compared to prior year’s net income of $343 million. Diluted earnings per share was $(0.81) versus $0.53 in the prior year.  Diluted earnings per share before special items was $(0.16) versus $(0.35) in the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA increased by $101 million, or 4%, to $2,453 million. Adjusted Net Income was $657 million versus $519 million in the prior year, an increase of $139 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,788 million, up from $1,592 million in the prior year. The increase was attributable to higher M&S revenue, increase in revenue from transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers, and a decrease in cash paid for fees associated with dividend payments in February and April 2017. These increases were partially offset by a net increase in cash interest paid due to the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities and higher interest rates on variable-rate debt, partially offset by a decrease in cash interest paid due to the partial redemption of the 9.250% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2023.Net cash used in investing activities was $1,738 million, compared to $1,413 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash used for Red Hawk and other business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in the volume of accounts purchased through the ADT Authorized Dealer Program.Net cash provided by financing activities was $193 million and consisted of net proceeds from the initial public offering and additional long-term borrowings, offset by payments related to the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities, the partial redemption of the 9.250% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2023, and dividend payments on common stock. In the prior year, net cash used in financing activities was $143 million and consisted of dividend payments on common stock, partially offset by the net proceeds from long-term borrowings.Free Cash Flow before special items was $538 million, up from $403 million in the prior year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily a result of an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, a decrease in cash paid associated with the dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities, excluding amounts associated with the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities, and lower interest expense on Prime Notes, partially offset by an increase in the volume of accounts purchased through the ADT Authorized Dealer Program.HIGHLIGHTSAcceleration of Commercial Growth - In December 2018, the Company closed its previously announced acquisition of Boca Raton, Florida based Red Hawk Fire & Security, a leader in commercial fire, life safety, and security services. This acquisition will help accelerate ADT’s growth in the commercial security market and expand the Company’s product portfolio with the introduction of commercial fire safety related 3solutions. In January 2019, ADT continued its commercial expansion with the acquisition of Advanced Cabling Systems, one of the leading technology integration companies in the mid-south.LifeShield: Expansion in the Company’s Growth Market with a DIY Home Security Platform - In February 2019, the Company closed the acquisition of LifeShield, LLC, a pioneer in advanced wireless home security systems. The addition of LifeShield’s innovative technology to ADT’s leading security and automation solutions and expertise increases ADT’s ability to address the approximately 80% of U.S.  households who do not have professionally installed and monitored home security. Founded in 2004, LifeShield was the first to bring a wireless DIY home security offering to the residential market.ADT Command & Control: Newly Redesigned Smart Home Security System - The Company unveiled its newly redesigned smart home security system - ADT Command & Control at the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January. ADT Command is a dynamic and innovative wireless panel with numerous smart home capabilities, including seamless set up and control with the ADT Control application, which allows customers to protect and automate their homes from anywhere at any time. ADT Command & Control is ADT’s next generation smart home and security platform, and successor to the industry leading Pulse platform. The Company began roll-out of the platform in the first quarter of 2019.Debt Redemption - The Company redeemed $300 million of its 9.250% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2023 on February 1, 2019 for a total price of $319 million. Following the redemption, the Company had $2,246 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes.Quarterly Dividend - Effective March 11, 2019, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.035 per share to common stockholders of record as of April 2, 2019. This dividend will be paid on April 12, 2019.DRIP and Share Buyback - On February 27, 2019, the Company also approved a DRIP which will allow stockholders to designate all or a portion of the cash dividends on their shares of common stock for reinvestment in additional shares of the Company’s common stock.  The Company anticipates that certain investment funds directly or indirectly managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates, collectively the Company’s controlling shareholder, will elect to participate in the DRIP for all the cash dividends it receives on its shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company will provide additional information regarding the DRIP pursuant to a separate announcement.  In addition, on February 27, 2019 the Company approved a share repurchase program which will permit the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of the Company’s shares of common stock through February 27, 2021.  The Company may effect these repurchases pursuant to one or more trading plans to be adopted in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5‐1, in privately negotiated transactions, in open market transactions or pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program.  The Company intends to conduct the share repurchase program in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-18.  The Company is not obligated to repurchase any of its shares of common stock and the timing and amount of any repurchases will depend on legal requirements, market conditions, stock price, alternative uses of capital, and other factors.Refinancing Opportunities - Consistent with our strategy, we also continue to evaluate our options to reduce interest expense and extend maturities, especially associated with our 9.25% second-priority senior secured notes. We intend to seek an amendment in the near term to our credit agreement to provide flexibility in connection with refinancing alternatives.42019 FINANCIAL OUTLOOKThe Company is providing the following financial guidance for 2019:(in millions, except attrition data)  Total Revenue   $4,900 - $5,100Adjusted EBITDA $2,460 - $2,500Free Cash Flow before special items $570 - $610Gross Customer Revenue Attrition 13.2% - 12.8%The Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our financial outlook for Adjusted EBITDA  and Free Cash Flow before special items to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, which are their respective corresponding GAAP measures because these GAAP measures that we exclude from our non-GAAP financial outlook are difficult to reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort due to their dependence on future uncertainties, such as special items discussed below under the heading — Non-GAAP Measures “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Free Cash Flow before special items.” Additionally, information that is currently not available to the Company could have a potentially unpredictable and potentially significant impact on its future GAAP financial results. ____________________________ (1) All variances are year-over-year unless otherwise noted.  Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items, Adjusted Net Income, and Diluted earnings per share before special items are non-GAAP measures.  Refer to the “Non-GAAP Measures” section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. The operating metrics Gross Revenue Attrition, Unit Count, RMR, RMR additions, and Revenue Payback are approximated as there may be variations to reported results in each period due to certain adjustments we might make in connection with the integration over several periods of acquired companies that calculated these metrics differently, or otherwise, including periodic reassessments and refinements in the ordinary course of business.  These refinements, for example, may include changes due to systems conversion or historical methodology differences in legacy systems. (2) Free Cash Flow before special items and Adjusted Net Income exclude outflows in connection with the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities including the accumulated dividend obligation of $96 million ($51 million related to Q1 and Q2 of 2018 and $45 million related to Q3 and Q4 of 2017).  Additionally, $41 million of dividend obligation payments on the Koch Preferred Securities in the first half of 2017 are included in Free Cash Flow before special items and Adjusted Net Income for 2017.Media Inquiries:Investor Relations:Mónica Talán - ADTmtalan@adt.comJason Smith - ADT   Sloan Bohlen - Solebury Communicationstel: 888.238.8525investorrelations@adt.com 5Conference Call Management will discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2018 results during a conference call and webcast today beginning at 5:00 p.m. (ET).

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDAWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items.  Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (viii) goodwill impairment losses (ix) financing and consent fees, (x) foreign currency gains/losses, (xi) losses on extinguishment of debt, (xii) radio conversion costs, (xiii) management fees and other charges, and (xiv) other non-cash items.There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.Free Cash FlowWe believe that the presentation of Free Cash Flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.We define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; subscriber system asset additions and deferred subscriber installation costs; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network.  These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt 7repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted.  These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.Free Cash Flow before special items We define Free Cash Flow before special items as Free Cash Flow adjusted for payments related to (i) financing and consent fees, (ii) restructuring and integration, (iii) integration related capital expenditures, (iv) management fees and other, (v) the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities, (vi) radio conversion costs, and (vii) other payments or receipts that may mask the operating results or business trends of the Company.  As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow before special items is a useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.Free Cash Flow before special items adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow before special items is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted.  These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow before special items in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. Adjusted Net IncomeAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present to provide additional information to investors about our operating performance.  We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA less (i) capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, (ii) cash taxes, and (iii) cash interest, including interest on our preferred securities and excluding outflows in connection with the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities.  Given our capital intensive business model, high debt levels, and the fact we are a low cash income tax paying Company due to our significant net operating loss, the Company uses this measure to reflect the cash portion of such adjusted items mentioned above to further evaluate our operational performance.  There are material limitations to using Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted Net Income does not fully take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted Net Income in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS before special itemsNet Income (Loss) before special items is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for (i) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (ii) financing and consent fees, (iii) foreign currency gains/losses, (iv) losses on extinguishment of debt, (v) radio conversion costs, (vi) share-based compensation expense, (vii) goodwill impairment losses, (viii) other non-cash items, and (ix) the impact these adjusted items have on taxes.  Diluted EPS before special items is diluted EPS adjusted for the items above.  The difference between Net Income (Loss) before special items and Diluted EPS before special items, and net income (loss) and diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure.  The Company believes that Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS both before special items are benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.  The limitation of these measures is that they exclude the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease our reported operating income, operating margin, net income or loss, and EPS.  This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measures in 8combination with the most comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSADT has made statements in this press release and other reports, filings, and other public written and verbal announcements that are forward-looking and therefore subject to risks and uncertainties, including under the heading 2019 Financial Outlook.

(NYSE: ADT), a leading provider of security and automation solutions for homes and businesses, today reported the results for its third quarter of 2018. “Along with exciting news on the strategic front, we also delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, with growth in revenues and year to date operating cash flow driven by improved operating metrics such as revenue payback and customer attrition,” stated Jim DeVries, ADT’s President and incoming CEO.  “Our agreement to acquire Red Hawk will expand our product offerings and nationwide capabilities, accelerating our expansion into the attractive commercial market.  Our expanded relationship with Amazon extends our security and automation reach, opening new sales and marketing opportunities for us in the residential market.  Both initiatives leverage our reputation and recognized brand to further enhance our opportunities.  We see our growth and shareholder value creation continuing to climb as we capitalize on our strategic initiatives and maintain our ultimate focus on customer service.”1THIRD QUARTER 2018 RESULTS(1)(2) Total revenue was $1.15 billion, up 6% year-over-year.  Monitoring and related services revenue (“M&S revenue”), which comprised $1.03 billion of total revenue, was up 2% over the same period last year.  The growth in M&S revenue was attributable to an increase in monthly recurring revenue, which resulted from the addition of new customers and improvements in average pricing, partially offset by customer attrition.  In addition to M&S revenue, installation and other revenue was up by an additional $48 million from last year, primarily driven by commercial revenues as a result of the successful execution of our commercial growth strategy. The Company reported a net loss of $236 million, compared to prior year’s net loss of $62 million.  The increase in net loss was due to $213 million from the Koch Redemption, partially offset by an increase in operating income and lower interest expense.  Diluted earnings per share was $(0.31) versus $(0.10) in the prior year.  Diluted earnings per share before special items was $(0.02) versus $(0.09) in the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $610 million, up 3%, or $15 million from the same period in the prior year.  Adjusted EBITDA growth in the third quarter was a result of higher M&S revenue combined with higher revenue from transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs.Adjusted Net Income was $194 million versus $208 million in the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $14 million.  The decrease in Adjusted Net Income was largely driven by an increase in the volume of accounts purchased through the ADT Authorized Dealer Program, partially offset by year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition improved 40 basis points year-over-year, ending at 13.4%.  The improvement was due to lower voluntary disconnects.Trailing twelve-month customer revenue payback improved to 2.4 years from 2.5 years in the third quarter of 2017.  The improvement was the result of year-over-year growth in RMR additions combined with more efficient subscriber acquisition spend. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of the year was $1,406 million, up from $1,262 million in the same period in the prior year.  The growth in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from an increase in revenue from contractual monthly recurring fees for monitoring and other recurring services, an increase in revenue from transactions in which security equipment is sold outright to customers partially offset by the associated costs, and a decrease in cash paid for fees associated with dividend payments in February and April 2017.  These increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by an increase in cash paid associated with the dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities, including amounts associated with the Koch Redemption.Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of the year was $1,084 million, compared to $1,049 million in the same period in the prior year.  The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of accounts purchased through the ADT Authorized Dealer Program.2Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of the year was $187 million and consisted of payments related to the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities, the repayment of long-term borrowings, and dividend payments on common stock, partially offset by net proceeds from the initial public offering.  In the same period prior year, net cash used in financing activities was $130 million and consisted of payments of dividends to our equity holders, partially offset by the net proceeds from long-term borrowings.Year to date Free Cash Flow before special items increased to $479 million from $381 million in the same period in the prior year.  The year-over-year improvement in Free Cash Flow before special items was primarily driven by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a decrease in cash paid associated with the dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities, excluding amounts associated with the Koch Redemption, partially offset by an increase in the volume of accounts purchased through the ADT Authorized Dealer Program.HIGHLIGHTSRed Hawk: Acceleration of Commercial Growth -  In October 2018, the Company announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Boca Raton, Florida based Red Hawk Fire & Security, a leader in commercial fire, life safety, and security services from Comvest Partners.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018.  This acquisition is anticipated to help accelerate ADT’s growth in the commercial security market and expand the Company’s product portfolio with the introduction of commercial fire safety related solutions.  Upon completion of the acquisition of Red Hawk, ADT is projected to have an increased geographic footprint and enhanced customer service capabilities across the nation.  The acquisition is expected to have compelling, long-term financial benefits and to be accretive to free cash flow generation, before taking into account meaningful expected cost benefits.  Revenues from the combined company’s business customers are estimated to represent approximately 25% of total revenue.Expansion of Amazon Relationship -  The Company announced an expanded relationship with Amazon in the third quarter of 2018, with ADT supporting integration of Amazon’s new Alexa Guard feature with the ADT Pulse security system.  The program is expected to begin prior to the end of 2018 and is anticipated to help customers enhance their home’s security capabilities by detecting specific sounds via the customer’s Amazon Echo device when they are away from home.  Once available, ADT professionally installed monitoring solutions are expected to be offered to customers through the Amazon website and mobile app.  The integration is ADT’s next step on the innovation roadmap and demonstrates continued successful collaboration with Amazon.  Additionally, ADT and Amazon are working together to provide offers and promotions to Amazon customers for ADT services and solutions, creating new sales and marketing opportunities for ADT.Koch Preferred Securities Redemption -  On July 2, 2018, the Company redeemed in full the original stated value of $750 million of the Koch Preferred Securities for a total consideration of approximately $949 million, which included $103 million related to the payment of the redemption premium, including tax reimbursements, and $96 million related to the accumulated dividend obligation on the Koch Preferred Securities.Quarterly Dividend - On November 7, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.035 per share to common stockholders of record as of December 14, 2018.  This dividend will be paid on January 4, 2019.32018 FINANCIAL OUTLOOKThe Company is raising and/or narrowing its 2018 outlook ranges for Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items(2), and Gross Customer Revenue Attrition as follows:(in millions, except attrition data) 2018 Prior 2018 RevisedTotal Revenue   $4,500 - $4,550 $4,525 - $4,550Adjusted EBITDA $2,425 - $2,435 $2,435 - $2,445Free Cash Flow before special items(2) $500 - $525 $515 - $535Gross Customer Revenue Attrition 13.0% - 13.3% 13.2% - 13.3%The Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our financial outlook for Adjusted EBITDA  and Free Cash Flow before special items to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, which are their respective corresponding GAAP measures because these GAAP measures that we exclude from our non-GAAP financial outlook are difficult to reliably predict or estimate without unreasonable effort due to their dependence on future uncertainties, such as special items discussed below under the heading — Non-GAAP Measures “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Free Cash Flow before special items.”  Additionally, information that is currently not available to the Company could have a potentially unpredictable and potentially significant impact on its future GAAP financial results. ____________________________ (1) All reported amounts are on a quarter-to-date basis unless otherwise noted.  All variances are year-over-year unless otherwise noted.  Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items, Adjusted Net Income, and Diluted earnings per share before special items are non-GAAP measures.  Refer to the “Non-GAAP Measures” section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. (2) Free Cash Flow before special items and Adjusted Net Income exclude outflows in connection with the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities including the accumulated dividend obligation of $96 million ($51 million related to Q1 and Q2 of 2018 and $45 million related to Q3 and Q4 of 2017).  Additionally, $41 million of dividend obligation payments on the Koch Preferred Securities in the first half of 2017 are included in Free Cash Flow before special items and Adjusted Net Income for 2017.Media Inquiries:Investor Relations:Adam Feigen - ADTtel: 561.322.7219afeigen@adt.comJason Smith - ADT   Sloan Bohlen - Solebury Communicationstel: 888.238.8525investorrelations@adt.com 4Conference Call Management will discuss the Company’s third quarter results during a conference call and webcast today beginning at 5:00 p.m. (ET).

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flows, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDAWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items.  Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (viii) financing and consent fees, (ix) foreign currency gains/losses, (x) losses on extinguishment of debt, (xi) radio conversion costs, (xii) management fees and other charges, and (xiii) other non-cash items.There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.Free Cash FlowWe define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; subscriber system asset additions; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network.  In arriving at Free Cash Flow, we subtract cash outlays related to capital expenditures from cash from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.  As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted.  These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.6Free Cash Flow before special items We define Free Cash Flow before special items as Free Cash Flow adjusted for (i) acquisitions, (ii) integrations, (iii) restructuring, (iv) Koch Redemption, and (v) other payments or receipts that may mask the operating results or business trends of the Company.  As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow before special items is a useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.Free Cash Flow before special items adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow before special items is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted.  These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow before special items in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. Adjusted Net IncomeAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present to provide additional information to investors about our operating performance.  We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA less (i) capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, (ii) cash taxes, and (iii) cash interest, including interest on our preferred securities and excluding outflows in connection with the Koch Redemption.  Given our capital intensive business model, high debt levels, and the fact we are a low cash income tax paying Company due to our significant net operating loss, the Company uses this measure to reflect the cash portion of such adjusted items mentioned above to further evaluate our operational performance.  There are material limitations to using Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted Net Income does not fully take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted Net Income in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS before special itemsNet Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS before special items are non-GAAP measures that may be used from time to time and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.  Net Income (Loss) before special items is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (iii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other, (iv) financing and consent fees, (v) foreign currency gains/losses, (vi) losses on extinguishment of debt, (vii) radio conversion costs, (viii) management fees and other charges, (ix) other non-cash items, and (x) the impact these adjusted items have on taxes.  Diluted EPS before special items is diluted EPS adjusted for the items above.  The difference between Net Income (Loss) before special items and Diluted EPS before special items, and net income (loss) and diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure.  The Company believes that Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS both before special items are benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.  The limitation of these measures is that they exclude the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease our reported operating income, operating margin, net income or loss, and EPS.  This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measures in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.7FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSADT has made statements in this press release and other reports, filings, and other public written and verbal announcements that are forward-looking and therefore subject to risks and uncertainties.

(NYSE: ADT) today reported the results for its second quarter of 2018. “Our team made great progress delivering across the key operating metrics that drove our financial performance this quarter, including stronger cash flow generation,” stated Tim Whall, ADT’s Chief Executive Officer.  “We also further strengthened our critical role at the center of the connected home while continuing to capitalize on attractive opportunities in the commercial business.  Looking ahead, through our disciplined approach we are positioned to deliver efficient and profitable growth that generates strong cash flow and ultimately attractive returns for our shareholders.”SECOND QUARTER 2018 RESULTS(1) Total revenue was $1.13 billion, up 6% year-over-year.  Monitoring and related services revenue (“M&S revenue”), which comprised $1.02 billion of total revenue, was up 2% over the same period last year.  The growth in M&S revenue was attributable to an increase in monthly recurring revenue, largely driven by higher average prices combined with improvements in gross customer revenue attrition.  In addition to M&S revenue, installation and other revenue was up by an additional $48 million from last year, primarily driven by commercial revenues as a result of the successful execution of our commercial growth strategy. 1The Company reported a net loss of $67 million, compared to prior year’s net loss of $93 million.  The improvement in net loss was due to growth in total revenue, lower interest expense, and higher other income primarily arising from a one-time license arrangement, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.  Diluted earnings per share was $(0.09) versus $(0.14) in the prior year.  Diluted earnings per share before special items was $(0.07) versus $(0.11) in the prior year.Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $610 million, up 5%, or $27 million from the same period in the prior year.  Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA growth was a result of higher M&S revenue combined with lower net costs associated with the acquisition of customers. Adjusted Net Income was $113 million versus $37 million in the same period in the prior year, an increase of $76 million.  The improvement in Adjusted Net Income was due to year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA and lower cash interest. Trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition improved 50 basis points year-over-year, ending at 13.6%.  The improvement was due to the Company’s focus on adding new high-quality customers and enhancing customer service levels in its field offices and call centers. Trailing twelve-month customer revenue payback improved to 2.4 years from 2.6 years in the second quarter of 2017.  The improvement was the result of more efficient sales and marketing spend combined with reductions in net installation costs largely driven by higher upfront revenue collection and other actions.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the first half of the year was $963 million, up from $743 million in the same period in the prior year.  The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA, lower cash interest paid, lower fees paid related to transactions with various investors and lenders, as well as the timing of other operating cash receipts and payments.  Net cash used in investing activities in the first half of the year was $696 million, compared to $649 million in the same period in the prior year, and primarily consisted of costs associated with the acquisition of customers through the Company’s direct and dealer channels.  The first half of 2018 also includes cash paid for acquisitions.  Net cash provided by financing activities in the first half of the year was $705 million and consisted primarily of the proceeds from our initial public offering, partially offset by repayments of our long-term borrowings.  In the same period in the prior year, net cash used in financing activities was $107 million and consisted of payments of dividends to our equity holders partially offset by the net proceeds from long-term borrowings.  Free Cash Flow before special items increased to $310 million from $191 million in the same period in the prior year.  The year-over-year improvement in Free Cash Flow before special items was driven by growth in Adjusted EBITDA, lower interest, and improvement in working capital and other.HIGHLIGHTSADT Go: Extending 24/7 Protection Beyond the Home -  The Company announced the launch of ADT Go in Q1 during this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.

All variances are year-over-year unless otherwise noted.  Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items, Adjusted Net Income, and Diluted earnings per share before special items are non-GAAP measures.  Refer to the “Non-GAAP Measures” section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDAWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items.  Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (viii) financing and consent fees, (ix) foreign currency gains/losses, (x) losses on extinguishment of debt, (xi) radio conversion costs, (xii) management fees and other charges, and (xiii) other non-cash items.There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.Free Cash FlowWe define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; subscriber system asset additions; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network.  In arriving at Free Cash Flow, we subtract cash outlays related to capital expenditures from cash from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.  As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow is useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted.  These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.5Free Cash Flow before special items We define Free Cash Flow before special items as Free Cash Flow adjusted for charges and gains related to (i) acquisitions, (ii) integrations, (iii) restructuring, (iv) impairments, and (v) other income or charges that may mask the operating results or business trends of the Company.  As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow before special items is useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.Free Cash Flow before special items adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow before special items is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted.  These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow before special items in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. Adjusted Net IncomeAdjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present to provide additional information to investors about our operating performance.  We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, (2) cash taxes, and (3) cash interest paid, including interest on our preferred securities.  Given our capital intensive business model, high debt levels, and the fact we are a low cash income tax paying Company due to our significant net operating loss, the Company uses this measure to reflect the cash portion of such adjusted items mentioned above to further evaluate our operational performance.  There are material limitations to using Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted Net Income does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted Net Income in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS before special itemsNet Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS before special items are non-GAAP measures that may be used from time to time and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.  Net Income (Loss) before special items is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) purchase accounting adjustments under GAAP, (iii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (iv) financing and consent fees, (v) foreign currency gains/losses, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vii) radio conversion costs, (viii) management fees and other charges, (ix) other non-cash items, and (x) the impact these adjusted items have on the effective tax rate. Diluted EPS before special items is diluted earnings per share adjusted for the items above.  The difference between Net Income (Loss) before special items and diluted EPS before special items, and net income (loss) and diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure.  The Company believes that Net Income (Loss) and Diluted EPS both before special items are benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.  The limitation of these measures is that they exclude the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease our reported operating income, operating margin, net income or loss, and EPS.  This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measures in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.6FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSADT has made statements in this press release and other reports, filings, and other public written and verbal announcements that are forward-looking and therefore subject to risks and uncertainties.

(NYSE: ADT) today reported the results for its first quarter of 2018. “We continue to build momentum and are off to a strong start in our first quarter operating as a public company,” said Tim Whall, ADT’s Chief Executive Officer.  “This quarter we continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth in revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow.  Operationally, we continued to execute on our commitment to enhance our customer service capabilities and implement operational improvements.  As a result, we lowered attrition to a new all-time low of 13.6% and improved revenue payback.  I am pleased with our first quarter results and our management team is excited to continue executing our strategy to drive free cash flow growth and create long-term shareholder value.” FIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTSThe Company reported total revenue of $1,116 million, a net loss of $157 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $620 million for the first quarter of 2018.  Total revenue was $1,116 million, up 5% year-over-year.  Monitoring and related services revenue (“M&S revenue”), which comprised $1,017 million of total revenue, was up 2% over the same period last year.  The growth in M&S revenue was attributable to an increase in monthly recurring revenue, largely driven by higher average prices combined with improvements in gross customer revenue attrition.  In addition to M&S 1revenue, total revenue was up by an additional $38 million from last year, primarily driven by commercial revenues as a result of the successful execution of our commercial growth strategy. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $620 million, up 7%, or $43 million from the same period last year.  First quarter Adjusted EBITDA growth was a result of higher M&S revenue, which flows through at higher margin rates, combined with lower expensed SAC, and lower G&A expenses.  The results include a net benefit of approximately $15 million, primarily attributable to a legal settlement.  Adjusted Net Income(2), which is a measurement of operating performance and is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash net interest expense, cash taxes, and net capitalized SAC, was $249 million versus $197 million last year, an increase of $52 million.  The improvement in Adjusted Net Income is due to year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA of $43 million and lower cash interest.  On a per share basis, Adjusted Net Income was $0.34, an increase of 10% from the same period last year.The Company reported a net loss of $157 million, compared to prior year’s loss of $141 million.  Excluding special items, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $(0.03) versus $(0.08) in the prior year. Trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition reached an all-time low in the quarter, ending at 13.6%, an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year.  The reduction is due to the Company’s focus on adding new high-quality customers and enhancing customer service levels in its field offices and call centers. Trailing twelve-month customer revenue payback improved to 2.5 years from 2.6 years in the first quarter of 2017.  The improvement was the result of more efficient sales and marketing spend as the Company identified opportunities to lower the cost per sale combined with reductions in net installation cost largely driven by variance performance management throughout its field offices.  Operating cash flow in the quarter was $505 million, up from $412 million in the same period last year, and free cash flow before special items grew to $187 million from $175 million.  The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow before special items was driven by growth in Adjusted EBITDA and lower interest, slightly offset by the quarterly timing of working capital and other.STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTSADT Go: Extending 24/7 Protection Beyond the Home - The Company announced the launch of ADT Go during this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.  ADT Go is an innovative and easy-to-use mobile app that transforms families’ smart phones into mobile personal security devices, giving users peace of mind in knowing loved ones are safe regardless of where life takes them.  The application was created in partnership with trusted locator and communication tool Life360 and offers 24/7 emergency response from ADT’s live monitoring agents, backed by Life360’s proprietary location technology. Expansion of Commercial Capabilities - The Company continued to further strengthen its footprint in the Commercial security market as it closed the acquisitions of Aronson Security Group (“Aronson”) and Acme Security Systems (“Acme”).  Headquartered in Renton, Washington, Aronson employs nearly 170 employees and has been in business over 55 years.  Acme Security Systems was among the largest privately held security system integrators in the Bay Area, and is focused on electronic systems, access control, and video networks.  Acme was founded in 1974 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.  The addition of two leading, strategic commercial security businesses to the ADT platform is an exciting step in ADT’s strategy to further drive commercial growth and expansion.2Awards & Recognition - The Company was recognized for its progress in its Commercial and Multi-Site channels and was presented with both the “Installer of the Year” and “Integrated Installation of the Year” awards during the security industry’s annual SAMMY awards ceremony.  Now in its 23rd year, the SAMMY Awards were created to recognize and honor best-in-class installing security dealers and integrators for their marketing, business, installation and overall excellence.“We continue to execute our strategy and make progress toward achieving our long-term goals.  Expanding our Commercial and Multi-Site capabilities is a key part of our strategy, and I am proud of the progress we have made so far,” said Whall.CAPITAL STRUCTURE HIGHLIGHTSQuarterly Dividend - On May 9, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.035 per share to common stockholders of record as of June 25, 2018.  This dividend will be paid on July 10, 2018. Redemption of Prime Notes - On February 21, 2018, the Company redeemed $594 million aggregate principal amount of the Prime Notes using a portion of the net proceeds received from the IPO, and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $62 million related to the payment of the call premium and the write-off of a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs.Capital Structure - The ratio of the Company’s net debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA implied net leverage of 4.0x as of March 31, 2018.  Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 totaled $258 million.  Additionally, the Company has set aside $750 million of restricted cash for the redemption of the principal balance of the Koch Preferred Securities.  The Company will redeem the Preferred Securities in July of 2018. (1)   All variances are year-over-year unless otherwise noted. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items, Adjusted Net Income, net income or loss before special items, diluted earnings per share before special items, and net leverage ratio are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Measures” section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. (2)   Adjusted Net Income was referred to as Cash Net Income in the prior quarter.  There has been no change in the calculation of the measure.Media Inquiries:Investor Relations:Jason Shockleytel: 561.322.7235jshockley@adt.com Jason Smith - ADT   Sloan Bohlen - Solebury Communicationstel: 817.928.1646investorrelations@adt.com Conference Call Management will discuss the Company’s first quarter results during a conference call and webcast today beginning at 8:30 a.m. (ET).

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items.  Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets, amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (viii) financing and consent fees, (ix) foreign currency gains/losses, (x) loss on extinguishment of debt, (xi) radio conversion costs, (xii) management fees and other charges, and (xiii) other non-cash items.There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.We define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; capitalized costs associated with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network.  In arriving at Free Cash Flow, we subtract cash outlays related to capital expenditures from cash from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities.  As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow is useful measure of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends.Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure.  Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted.  These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present to provide additional information to investors about our operating performance.  We define Adjusted Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, (2) cash taxes, and (3) cash interest paid, including interest on our preferred securities.  Given our capital intensive business model, high debt levels, and the fact we are a low cash 5income tax paying Company due to our significant net operating loss, the Company uses this measure to reflect the cash portion of such adjusted items mentioned above to further evaluate our operational performance.  There are material limitations to using Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted Net Income does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income or loss.  These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted Net Income in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Diluted EPS before special items is a non-GAAP measure that may be used from time to time and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results.  Diluted EPS before special items is defined as earnings per diluted share adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (iii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (iv) financing and consent fees, (v) foreign currency gains/losses, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vii) radio conversion costs, (viii) management fees and other charges, (ix) other non-cash items, and (x) the impact these adjusted items have on the effective tax rate.  The difference between net income or loss and diluted EPS before special items and net income or loss and diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure.  The Company believes that diluted EPS before special items is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although our measure of diluted EPS before special items may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease our reported operating income, operating margin, net income or loss and EPS.  This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measure in combination with the most comparable GAAP measure in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.The leverage ratio may be presented as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total debt.  The leverage ratio is a useful measure of the Company’s credit position and progress towards leverage targets.  Refer to the discussion on Adjusted EBITDA for a description of the differences between the most comparable GAAP measure.  The calculation is limited in that the Company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.The Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial outlook, if presented herein, to the corresponding GAAP information because the GAAP measures that we exclude from our non-GAAP financial outlook, other than those described above, are difficult to predict and are primarily dependent on future uncertainties.  The GAAP measures excluded from our non-GAAP financial outlook for which we do not prepare a reconcilable GAAP forecast include the factors described above, where applicable.6FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSADT has made statements in this press release and other reports, filings, and other public written and verbal announcements that are forward-looking and therefore subject to risks and uncertainties.

(NYSE: ADT) today reported the results for its fourth quarter and full year 2017.  The Company also provided guidance for 2018 and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per share.“Our fourth quarter results reflect a very strong finish to 2017.  We grew revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow year-over-year, and we also meaningfully reduced customer attrition while improving customer acquisition efficiency.  Following our initial public offering, we are excited about the future of ADT and our ability to drive significant cash flow growth as we continue to execute against our strategic objectives,” said Tim Whall, ADT’s Chief Executive Officer.FOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTSThe Company reported total revenue of $1,106 million, net income of $638 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $598 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.  1Total revenue, which includes revenue generated from monitoring and related services (“M&S revenue”), installation and other revenue, was $1,106 million, up 5% over the prior year period.  M&S revenue, which made up approximately 92% of total revenue in the quarter, was $1,012 million, up 2% over the same period last year.  The growth in M&S revenue was driven by improvements in customer revenue attrition and higher average price.  The remaining increase in total revenue was driven by higher outright sales and incremental amortization of deferred installation revenue.Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter totaled $598 million, an 8% increase over the prior year period.  Growth in fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the higher M&S revenue, lower net expense associated with subscriber acquisition costs (“SAC”), and efficiency improvements in operating costs, partially offset by investments in customer service improvements.The Company reported net income of $638 million, up from negative $85 million last year, and diluted earnings per share of $0.99 versus $(0.13) in the prior year.  Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share was $(0.06) versus $(0.07) in the same period last year. The net income results include a $690 million tax benefit due to the 2017 Tax Reform.Trailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition for the quarter was 13.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, as the Company focused on higher quality customer additions and executed operational improvements to enhance customer service levels. Trailing twelve-month customer revenue payback, which measures how many years it will take the Company to recover, via new revenue, its net expenditures on customer acquisitions and installation costs, improved to 2.5 years compared to 2.7 years in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The improvement was the result of more targeted marketing and sales expenditures, efficiencies in installation costs, and increased up-front installation revenue.  Operating cash flow in the quarter was $330 million, up from $236 million from the same period last year. Free cash flow before special items was $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from negative $42 million in the same period last year.  Fourth quarter 2017 cash net income totaled $76 million, an increase of $66 million over the prior year period.  The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow before special items and cash net income was driven by EBITDA improvements, efficiency gains in SAC, and lower cash interest.FULL YEAR 2017 RESULTSOn a full year basis, the Company reported total revenue of $4,316 million and M&S Revenue of $4,029 million, up 4% and 2%, respectively, when compared to 2016 pro forma results.  Adjusted EBITDA increased by $176 million, or 8%, to $2,353 million.  Net income was $343 million, up from a net loss of $285 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.53, up from $(0.44) last year.  Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share for the year was $(0.35) compared to $(0.20) in 2016.  Operating cash flow was $1,592 million, up 39% year-over-year, and free cash flow before special items was $403 million, up from $331 million in 2016. “Beyond our strong financial performance, we fully integrated legacy ADT and Protection One field operations during 2017.  We deployed tools and processes to drive operational performance and we strengthened our customer focused culture within our direct and dealer channels.  Our strong performance is the result of the hard work from the men and women at ADT throughout our local offices and call centers across North America.  I am proud that our entire organization, our employees and our dealer partners, are laser focused on serving our customers,” said Whall.2CAPITAL STRUCTURE HIGHLIGHTSInitial Public Offering - On January 23rd, 2018, the Company closed its initial public offering of 105 million shares of common stock, which generated gross proceeds of $1,470 million.  The Company used these proceeds to redeem approximately $594 million of 2nd Lien Notes, to deposit $750 million into a segregated account for the purpose of redeeming the Koch Preferred Securities at a future date, and to pay related fees and expenses.Quarterly Dividend - On March 15, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.035 per share payable on April 5, 2018 to common stockholders of record on March 26, 2018. Capital Structure - Pro forma for our initial public offering and use of proceeds, including the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities, the ratio of the Company’s net debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA implied net leverage of 4.1x as of December 31, 2017.  Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 totaled $123 million.2018 FINANCIAL OUTLOOKThe Company is providing the following financial guidance for 2018:•Total revenue between $4,450 million and $4,550 million•Adjusted EBITDA between $2,415 million and $2,435 million•Free cash flow before special items between $475 million and $525 million•Gross customer revenue attrition between 13.0% and 13.3% (1)   All variances are year-over-year unless otherwise noted. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items, Cash Net Income, net income or loss before special items, diluted earnings per share before special items, and net leverage ratio are non-GAAP measures.

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We believe the presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to illustrate the effect that the ADT Acquisition had on our Adjusted EBITDA, assuming that such transaction took place on January 1, 2015.We define Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets, amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (viii) financing and consent fees, (ix) foreign currency gains/losses, (x) loss on extinguishment of debt, (xi) radio conversion costs, (xii) management fees and other charges, and (xiii) other non-cash items.There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.We define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; capitalized costs associated with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network.  Historical Combined Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures and reports, on a combined basis, the Historical Free Cash Flow results for the Company and The ADT Corporation, where applicable, for the periods presented.  In arriving at Free Cash Flow and Historical Combined Free Cash Flow, we subtract cash outlays related to capital expenditures from cash from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow and Historical Combined Free Cash Flow are useful measures of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Historical Combined Free Cash Flow further adjusts for certain cash items that are consistent with adjustments included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. 5Free Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers. Cash Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present to provide additional information to investors about our operating performance.  We define Cash Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, (2) cash taxes, and (3) cash interest paid, including interest on our preferred securities.  Given our capital intensive business model, high debt levels, and the fact we are a low cash income tax paying Company due to our significant net operating loss, the Company uses this measure to reflect the cash portion of such adjusted items mentioned above to further evaluate our operational performance.  There are material limitations to using Cash Net Income. Cash Net Income does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Cash Net Income in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Diluted EPS before special items is a non-GAAP measure that may be used from time to time and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results. Diluted EPS before special items is defined as earnings per diluted share adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (iii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (iv) financing and consent fees, (v) foreign currency gains/losses, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vii) radio conversion costs, (viii) management fees and other charges, (ix) other non-cash items, and (x) the impact these adjusted items have on the effective tax rate.  The difference between net income or loss and diluted EPS before special items and net income or loss and diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure. The Company believes that diluted EPS before special items is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although our measure of diluted EPS before special items may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease our reported operating income, operating margin, net income or loss and EPS. This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measure in combination with the most comparable GAAP measure in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.The leverage ratio may be presented as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total debt.  The leverage ratio is a useful measure of the Company’s credit position and progress towards leverage targets.  Refer to the discussion on Adjusted EBITDA for a description of the differences between the most comparable GAAP measure. The calculation is limited in that the Company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.The Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial outlook to the corresponding GAAP information because the GAAP measures that we exclude from our non-GAAP financial outlook, other than those described above, are difficult to predict and are primarily dependent on future uncertainties. The GAAP measures excluded from our non-GAAP financial outlook for which we do not prepare a reconcilable GAAP forecast include the factors described above, where applicable.6FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSADT has made statements in this press release and other reports, filings, and other public written and verbal announcements that are forward-looking and therefore subject to risks and uncertainties.  All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this document are, or could be, “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided thereunder.
