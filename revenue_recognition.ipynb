Our conclusion that redemption is unlikely is based on an analysis of historical trends. Because we started our gift card program in 2012, we have not had a sufficient level of historical redemption rates to allow us to reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards sold that would be unredeemed (\"breakage rate\").  We were able to reasonably estimate the breakage rate for other advanced sale-type certificates based on historical redemption rates, as these programs have been in effect for a significant period of time. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we concluded that a sufficient level of historical redemption rates had been established to allow us to reasonably estimate the breakage rate on unredeemed gift cards. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized breakage income from gift cards of approximately </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\" data-cbfactid=\"-1\" data-cbnumtext=\"$3055\">$3,055</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">.

Furthermore, because the Phase I deployment installation period ended in November 2007, a majority of the VPF revenue associated with the Phase I systems will end by November 2017. While the absence of such revenue was not material to our consolidated financial statements during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, it is expected to have a material impact in subsequent periods.

We expect to continue to earn ancillary revenue streams from the Phase I deployment Systems through December of 2020; however, such amounts are expected to be significantly less material to our consolidated financial statements.  The expected reduction in VPF revenue on our Phase I systems is scheduled to approximately coincide with the conclusion of certain of our non-recourse debt obligations and, therefore, we expect that reduced cash outflows related to such non-recourse debt obligations will partially offset reduced VPF revenue after November 2017.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Phase 2 DC&#8217;s agreements with distributors require the payment of VPFs, according to a defined fee schedule, for </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">ten</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"> years from the date each system is installed; however, Phase 2 DC may no longer collect VPFs once &#8220;cost recoupment,&#8221; as defined in the contracts with movie studios and distributors, is achieved. Cost recoupment will occur once the cumulative VPFs and other cash receipts collected by Phase 2 DC have equaled the total of all cash outflows, including the purchase price of all Systems, all financing costs, all &#8220;overhead and ongoing costs&#8221;, as defined, and including service fees, subject to maximum agreed upon amounts during the three-year rollout period and thereafter. Further, if cost recoupment occurs before the end of the </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">eighth</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"> contract year, the studios will pay us a one-time &#8220;cost recoupment bonus.&#8221;&#160; Any other cash flows, net of expenses, received by Phase 2 DC following the achievement of cost recoupment are required to be returned to the distributors on a pro-rata basis. At this time, we cannot estimate the timing or probability of the achievement of cost recoupment. Beginning in December 2018, certain Phase 2 DC Systems will have reached the conclusion of their deployment payment period, subject to earlier achievement of cost recoupment. In accordance with existing agreements with distributors, VPF revenues will cease to be recognized on such Systems.

Depending upon the nature of the agreements with the platform and content providers, the fee rate that we earn varies. Generally, revenues are recognized when content is available for subscription on the digital platform, at the time of shipment for physical goods, or point-of-sale for transactional and VOD services. Reserves for sales returns and other allowances are recorded based upon historical experience. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, adjustments to our allowances may be required.

As is typical in the film industry, the Company's distributors may make adjustments in future periods to information previously provided to the Company that could have a material impact on the Company's operating results in later periods. Furthermore, management may, in its judgment, make material adjustments to the information reported by its distributors in future periods to ensure that revenues are accurately reflected in the Company's financial statements. To date, the distributors have not made, nor has the Company made, subsequent material adjustments to information</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"> </font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">provided by the distributors and used in the preparation of the Company's historical financial statements.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Revenue from the theatrical exhibition of films is recognized at the later of when a film is exhibited in theaters or when revenue is reported by the Company's distributors.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Revenue from both free and pay television licensing agreements for the Company's films is recognized at the later of the time the production is made available for exhibition in those markets or it is reported by its distributors.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">The Company has also entered into licensing arrangements directly with third parties to digitally distribute its feature film and television series/specials content. Such revenues are recorded on a gross basis as they are not typically subject to the distribution arrangements with the Company's primary distributors and, accordingly, the Company receives payment and records revenues directly from third parties. Revenues generated under these licensing arrangements is recognized at the later of the time when the content has been delivered to and accepted by the licensee or the commencement of the license term. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Revenue from the sale of feature film home video units is recognized at the later of when product is made available for retail sale and&#160;when sales to customers are reported by third parties, such as fulfillment service providers or distributors. Revenue from the sale of home video units for other content (such as television series/specials) is recorded on a gross basis (because the Company is considered the principal in the transactions) and is recognized when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Certain of the Company's home video distribution arrangements for its non-feature film content include non-refundable, but recoupable, minimum guarantees. Minimum guarantees that are not fully recouped are recognized as revenue once the minimum guarantee period has expired and the Company is able to determine the amount of remaining revenues to be recognized. The criteria the Company evaluates to determine whether it is able to recognize revenue include persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, risk of inventory loss has transferred and collectibility is reasonably assured. </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">In addition, the Company and its distributors provide for future returns of home video product and for customer programs and sales incentives. The Company and its distributors calculates these estimates by analyzing a combination of historical returns, current economic trends, projections of consumer demand for the Company's product and point-of-sale data available from certain retailers. Based on this information, a percentage of each sale is reserved. Customers are typically given varying rights of return, which may include <span data-cbfactid=\"113242721\" data-cbnetworkid=\"28115257\">100%</span> return rights. Although the Company and its distributors allow various rights of return for customers, management does not believe that these rights are critical in establishing return estimates, because other factors, such as historical experience with similar types of sales, information received from retailers and management's assessment of the product's appeal based on domestic box office success and other research, are more important to the estimation process.</font><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"> </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Revenue from merchandising and other licensing arrangements is recognized when the associated feature film or television series/special has been released and the criteria for revenue recognition have been met. The criteria that the Company uses to evaluate whether it is able to recognize revenue include the following: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered (including whether the license term has commenced) and collectibility is reasonably assured. Licensing and merchandising related minimum guarantees are generally recognized as revenue upon the theatrical release of a film and royalty-based revenues (revenues based upon a percentage of net sales of the products) are generally recognized as revenue in periods when royalties are reported by licensees or cash is received.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Certain of the Company's arrangements may qualify as multiple deliverable arrangements if the licensee is granted the right to exploit more than one of the Company's titles or properties. The license period for each property under a multiple deliverable arrangement may vary by title or property. Revenue associated with multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to each title or property based on relative selling price. In determining the relative selling price of each title or property, the Company considers a variety of factors including (but not limited to) the period of time a title or property has already been exploited in the marketplace, whether the title is a sequel, the duration of the license period being granted, the territories for which the license is being granted, similar arrangements and type of content or property being licensed. Revenue for each title or property will be recognized when it is available to the licensee for exploitation.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">As a result of one of the Company's agreements with Netflix, it is currently developing and producing original episodic content in order to fulfill its obligations under the agreement. In cases where a television series is based on characters from one of the Company's feature films, a portion of the third-party revenues generated by the new series is allocated to the feature film title from which the series originated. This revenue allocation represents a license fee charged to the television series for use of intellectual property derived from the related feature film.  </font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\">Long-term, non-interest-bearing receivables arising from licensing agreements are discounted to present value. Accordingly, revenues are recorded net of such discount. Interest income is recognized from the imputation of interest in accordance with the effective interest rate method and classified as \"Interest income, net\" in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.</font></div><div style=\"line-height:120%;text-indent:36px;font-size:10pt;\"><font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;\"><br clear=\"none\"></font></div></div>"
